Originally written for the soundtrack of 1998 film City of Angels, the song was later included on the band's sixth album Dizzy Up the Girl. \"Iris\" has contributed greatly to the band's success.\n\nThe instrumentals in the song are heavily driven by guitar riffs, mandolin, violins, and cellos, with a steady drum beat beneath. The acoustic guitar in the song gives a distinctive sound as it is in an odd tuning, with 5 of the 6 strings tuned to D. This gives a ringing effect similar to a 12-string guitar.\n\nIt was the first song that the Goo Goo Dolls had been asked to write specifically for a film. Songwriter Johnny Rzeznik has been quoted as saying he broke several years of writer's block and several years of sobriety simultaneously the night he wrote this track.\n\nIn the music video the band is shown high up in skyscrapers, watching the lives of people through telescopes. Seen throughout the video is the actor Nicolas Cage. This theme reflects on what the angels do in the film. Interspersed throughout the video are clips from the film depicting scenes where Seth is falling in love and deciding whether or not to give up being an angel.\n\nThe song was named \"Iris\" by guitarist/vocalist John Rzeznik for Iris DeMent. Rzeznik found an article about her written by Daniel Levitin while flipping through an issue of Billboard Magazine, and thought she had a nice name, and thus chose it for the song title.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yvxxxq1340735459.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdYWuo9OFAw", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "48118047", "intMusicVidLikes": "250305", "intMusicVidDislikes": "2657", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.83333", "intScoreVotes": "6", "intTotalListeners": "1327131", "intTotalPlays": "9832099", "strMusicBrainzID": "57d079a0-a195-453e-bb01-9ccff26a5de2", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "097ff669-1ff3-39a7-b981-b8e50a905856", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "e2c00c56-8365-4160-9f40-a64682917633", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
