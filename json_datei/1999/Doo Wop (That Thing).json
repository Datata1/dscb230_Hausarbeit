The song is taken from her debut album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Written and produced by Hill, the song was released as the album's lead single in July 1998. It was Hill's first and only Billboard Hot 100 number-one, to date. The song won Best Female R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song at the 1999 Grammy Awards on February 24, 1999. \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the tenth song in the chart's history to do so, and the first debut single to do so.\n\nThe song's music video, directed by Big TV!, was filmed in Manhattan's Washington Heights, with the video showing two Hills singing side by side at a block party. On the left side of the split screen, she is dressed in full late 1960s attire, complete with a bob cut and a zebra-striped dress, paying homage to older R&B and doo wop, and on the right side of the screen, the present-day Hill is shown in a homage to hip hop culture. Slant Magazine's Paul Schrodt praised the \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" music video, stating \"The resulting split-screen music video is the most flabbergasting testament to what the neo soul movement is all about.\"\n\nThe video won Video of the Year at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rgfme91616242694.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6QKqFPRZSA", "strMusicVidDirector": "Big TV!", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "89229053", "intMusicVidLikes": "522142", "intMusicVidDislikes": "15453", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "14175", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "83f4ab28-f069-4fe7-8071-41ab81e138c3", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "8691d12c-abd8-385c-b1eb-d841190124f7", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "e8414012-4a1c-4ad4-be5e-fc55294e28cc", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
