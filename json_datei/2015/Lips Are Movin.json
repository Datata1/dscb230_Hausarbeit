Trainor co-wrote it with Kevin Kadish, who produced it as well. Epic Records released it on October 21, 2014, as the second single from Trainor's fourth studio album Title (2015). \"Lips Are Movin\" was announced in October 2014, along with its official single artwork, and release to radio stations in the same month. \"Lips Are Movin\" is a bubblegum pop, doo-wop and R&B song with wry lyrics about a philandering, untruthful man.\n\nComparing it to Trainor's previous single \"All About That Bass\", critics stated that \"Lips Are Movin\" elevated Trainor from a one-hit wonder to a successful pop act. \"Lips Are Movin\" was a commercial success, becoming Trainor's second consecutive single to reach the top five in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at numbers three, two, and four, respectively. It also reached the top ten in several European countries, including Austria, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\nPhilip Andelman directed the music video for \"Lips Are Movin\" and Hewlett-Packard commissioned it. It portrays behind-the-scenes events during the shoot of a music video, featuring dancers that include Les Twins and Chachi Gonzales.

It includes half-sung, half-rapped vocals and a retro-soul melody with beats and a percussion-heavy arrangement. VH1 described it as \"a feisty, upbeat track\" that \"has some spunky lyrics\". According to James Cowan of Canadian Business, the song \"shares the same girl-group-influenced harmonies, wry lyrics and candy palette\" of its predecessor, \"All About That Bass\". Musically, \"Lips Are Movin\" was likened to Christina Aguilera's \"Candyman\" (2007) by Carl Smith of Sugarscape.com. The song's tempo is 139 beats per minute. It is composed in the key G major.
