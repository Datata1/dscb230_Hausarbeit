All suffering from vignettes of love, loss, poverty, and imprisonment, all set over Levine's crooned chorus \"If I got locked away / and we lost it all today / tell me honestly / would you still love me the same?\"", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tvtrrt1488800838.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GUm5g8SG4o", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "453941477", "intMusicVidLikes": "2010702", "intMusicVidDislikes": "54212", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "68567", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "9a6ecc3a-5607-475a-856b-b43428ffb861", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "d1ec8c31-20c1-4e87-b972-884eed9f9a4c", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "71c9d02a-12d5-4a0c-96c7-a036ff242737", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
