It was written by Lo with Ludvig S\u00f6derberg and Jakob Jerlstr\u00f6m, while it was produced by the latter two under the production name The Struts. Initially, the singer self-released the song under the title \"Habits\" on 15 March 2013 as her second independently-released single. After Lo was signed to Universal Music, the track was re-released on 6 December 2013 under the title of \"Habits (Stay High)\" as both the second single from Truth Serum and the lead single from Queen of the Clouds. Musically, it is a pop and electropop song which features a minimal and upbeat electronic instrumentation. Its lyrics delve into the singer's attempts to forget her previous boyfriend through substance abuse, drinking and other hedonistic practices. Consequently, some critics and Lo herself noted a contrast between the song's production and its lyrical content.\n\nTwo music videos were filmed for the song, both directed by Motellet Film. The first version, released on 15 March 2013, featured the singer at a tea party while getting drunk with her guests. It reached half-a-million views on YouTube before it was made private one year after its release. The second version was filmed at a Swedish club over three days and depicts Lo in a night of partying with her friends.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rup7cx1645562574.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh2LWWORoiM", "strMusicVidDirector": "Motellet", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "296283050", "intMusicVidLikes": "2077051", "intMusicVidDislikes": "68250", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "70267", "intTrackNumber": "13", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.8", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "359458", "intTotalPlays": "3395538", "strMusicBrainzID": "4358324c-03c3-4010-8eef-6e82b7756034", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "91d3a3b7-1814-4088-84b9-5740c1e3efd9", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "56756959-1e78-429c-b897-e1d056cb0225", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
