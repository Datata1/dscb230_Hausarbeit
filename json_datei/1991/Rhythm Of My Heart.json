In 1991, British singer Rod Stewart recorded the song for his album Vagabond Heart with production by Trevor Horn. It is the album's opening track and was released as its first single on 4 March 1991.\n\nStewart's version reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 on the Canadian and Irish charts. The melody is an adaptation of \"Loch Lomond\". The meter, stanzas and lyrics are also based on the poem, a nod to Stewart's own Scottish heritage. Eric Rigler played the Great Highland bagpipes heard during Stewart's version.\n\n\"Rhythm of My Heart\" was also covered by Runrig, who released it as a single in 1996. This is the version heard on the Loch Ness soundtrack when it was released on CD in 2005, instead of Stewart's version heard in the movie. A live version of the song from his 2013 performance at The Troubadour, West Hollywood was included on the deluxe edition of the album Time. Amy Macdonald and Stewart performed the song (with adjusted lyrics) at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmljreTAgYI", "strMusicVidDirector": "Caleb Deschanel", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "9699862", "intMusicVidLikes": "58429", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "2517", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "38623", "intTotalPlays": "156255", "strMusicBrainzID": "56e3370a-5504-4c4f-b9a7-60b39ef56eed", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "f57bc26d-2ce4-3286-b511-54408268e399", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "a35237a0-4f47-40a6-b6f3-1e786db23402", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
