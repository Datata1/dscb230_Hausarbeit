It is the fifth track and third single from their 1990 album Pornograffitti. It is a ballad built around acoustic guitar work by Nuno Bettencourt and the vocals of Gary Cherone (with harmony vocals from Bettencourt). The song is a detour from the funk metal style that permeates the band's records. As such, it has often been described as \"a blessing and a curse\" due to its overwhelming success and recognition worldwide, but the band ultimately embraced it and plays it at every show.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "Sayin' I love you\nIs not the words I want to hear from you\nIt's not that I want you\nNot to say it, but if you only knew\nHow easy it would be to show me how you feel\nMore than words is all you have to do to make it real\nThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me\nCause I'd already know\n\nWhat would you do if my heart was torn in two?\nMore than words to show you feel\nThat your love for me is real\nWhat would you say if I took those words away?\nThen you couldn't make things new\nJust by saying I love you\n\n(la di da, blah di da da dada)\nMore than words\n(lad di da da di da)\n\nNow that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand\nAll you have to do is close your eyes\nAnd just reach out your hands and touch me\nHold me close don't ever let me go\nMore than words is all I ever needed you to show\nThen you wouldn't have to say that you love me\nCause I'd already know\n\nWhat would you do if my heart was torn in two?\nMore than words to show you feel\nThat your love for me is real\nWhat would you say if I took those words away?\nThen you couldn't make things new\nJust by saying I love you\n\n(la di da da di da di da da da)\nMore than words\n(la di da da di da di da da da)\nMore than words\n(la di da da di da di da da da)\nMore than words\n(la di da da di da di da da da)\n\nla di da da da da\n\nMore than words\nOoooohhhhhhh ooooohhhhhhh\n\nMore than...
