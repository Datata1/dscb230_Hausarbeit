The power ballad was composed and written by the band's lead singer Klaus Meine and produced by Keith Olsen and the band. The lyrics were composed by Meine following the band's visit to the Soviet Union at the height of perestroika, when the enmity between the communist and capitalist blocs subsided concurrently with the promulgation of large-scale socioeconomic reforms in the Soviet Union.\n\n\"Wind of Change\" was released as the album's third single on 21 January 1991 and became a worldwide hit, just after the failed coup that would eventually lead to the end of the Soviet Union. The song topped the charts in Germany and across Europe and peaked at number four in the United States and at number two in the United Kingdom. It later appeared on the band's 1995 live album Live Bites, their 2000 album with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, Moment of Glory, and on their 2001 \"unplugged\" album Acoustica. The band also recorded a Russian-language version of the song, under the title \"\u0412\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\" (\"Veter Peremen\") and a Spanish version called \"Vientos de Cambio\" \"(Winds of Change)\".\n\nWith estimated sales of 14 million copies sold worldwide, \"Wind of Change\" is one of the best-selling singles of all time. It holds the record for the best-selling single by a German artist. The band presented a gold record and $70,000 of royalties from the single to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991, with Soviet news sources claiming the money would be allocated to children's hospitals.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/utxvrv1582623749.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4RjJKxsamQ", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vwppru1582623757.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/tprpvy1582623763.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ypvxvs1582623771.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "985417430", "intMusicVidLikes": "4563488", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "132638", "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "691925", "intTotalPlays": "4510387", "strMusicBrainzID": "ed7a45e1-fabb-4a83-a5c1-f68cf4711823", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "d8a27312-3b03-36a0-a184-49b032528c1d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "c3cceeed-3332-4cf0-8c4c-bbde425147b6", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
