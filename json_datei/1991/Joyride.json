The single topped the charts across Europe, and in Australia, Canada and the United States, where it spent one week at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, their last to do so, in May 1991. In the UK, \"Joyride\" peaked at #4.\n\nIn interviews, Gessle states he got the idea for the opening line of this song from his girlfriend (now wife) who left a note on his piano that stated, \"Hello, you fool, I love you.\"\n\nIn the opening section of the song, a man is heard saying \"Come on, join the joyride everybody, get your tickets here, step right this way\", in a possible homage to The Beatles' song \"Magical Mystery Tour\", where at the opening section, Paul McCartney is heard saying \"Roll up, roll up for the Magical Mystery Tour! Step right this way!\".\n\nIn 1991, Alvin and the Chipmunks and The Chipettes covered the song for their album The Chipmunks Rock the House.\n\nDuring the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs this became the intro anthem to the Vancouver Canucks as they took the ice before each game.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/txstup1355068733.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://youtu.be/xCorJG9mubk", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "10544720", "intMusicVidLikes": "27963", "intMusicVidDislikes": "579", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "3", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "170496", "intTotalPlays": "750824", "strMusicBrainzID": "82c72383-3863-4502-bf2a-cd1a53e2c489", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2f36e6f3-b504-3ed4-b1e8-7971fd7b5632", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "d3b2711f-2baa-441a-be95-14945ca7e6ea", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
