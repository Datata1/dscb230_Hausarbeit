Unfortunately, the tattoo artist, according to Michaels, had been drinking and spelled \"believe\" incorrectly putting the \"e\" before the \"i\". It was attempted to be corrected by adding a rose to the cross that covered the misspelling, but Michaels was never satisfied with the results. In the first season of the reality show Rock of Love, Michaels goes to a tattoo shop where the tattoo artist properly touches up the tattoo.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tvrxwx1356106990.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5uamDMoW4o", "strMusicVidDirector": "Marty Callner", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "5805331", "intMusicVidLikes": "27848", "intMusicVidDislikes": "509", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "6", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "77385", "intTotalPlays": "305486", "strMusicBrainzID": "0c26c80f-f78b-4f29-b4dc-37132745c5a7", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "f119385d-c478-3762-9bfe-7a751b58f493", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "c79c43d4-cbed-4373-89ce-6560f62eb7d8", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
