It was written by Rick Astley and Rob Fisher. The Andra\u00e9 Crouch Choir provided backing vocals.\n\nReleased as a single in January 1991, \"Cry for Help\" reached the Top 10 on both the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom as well as the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, where the song peaked at No. 7 on both sides of the Atlantic. It reached No. 3 in Canada, and it was a No. 1 hit on the U.S. adult contemporary chart. The song's No. 7 UK chart placing meant that Astley became the first male solo artist to have his first eight singles reach the British Top 10.\n\nThe song is a soul ballad, unlike Astley's other more dance-oriented hit singles (such as \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"). It was co-written by British singer-songwriter Rob Fisher, formerly one half of the 1980s pop outfits Naked Eyes and Climie Fisher. To date, the song was Astley's last appearance in the Top 10 in either the U.S. or U.K.\n\nThe song has been sung by Rick Astley in duet with Soren Sko and covered by Thomas Anders (ex-Modern Talking).", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rvsupt1582748600.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2xel6q0yao", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/spqsuq1582748639.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qvrrqp1582748647.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vtquwq1582748655.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "16574972", "intMusicVidLikes": "101870", "intMusicVidDislikes": "2952", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "7789", "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "32776", "intTotalPlays": "117757", "strMusicBrainzID": "297dcc02-ac2a-4ae2-95c7-329ac92435b0", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "8d69860f-3de7-38c6-8ab1-a66f7bbb2c5b", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "db92a151-1ac2-438b-bc43-b82e149ddd50", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
