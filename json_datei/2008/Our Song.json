The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman. It was released on August 22, 2007 by Big Machine Records as the third single from Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). Swift solely composed \"Our Song\" for the talent show of her freshman year in high school, about a boyfriend who she did not have a song with. It was included on Taylor Swift as she recalled its popularity with her classmates. The uptempo track is musically driven mainly by banjo and lyrically describes a young couple who use the events in their lives in place of a regular song.\n\n\"Our Song\" was met with great praise from contemporary critics, some who deemed it one of Swift's best singles, and commercial success. The song charted within the top 30 and top 20 on the Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Hot 100, respectively. In the United States, it became Swift's first number one single on the Hot Country Songs Chart, maintaining the position for six consecutive weeks, and was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A music video accompanying \"Our Song\" was directed by Trey Fanjoy and features Swift performing in various settings, including a front porch. The video won both nominations for \"Video of the Year\" and \"Female Video of the Year\" at the 2008 CMT Music Awards. Swift has performed the song at an abundance of venues, some while supporting as opening act for various country artists' concert tours. She also performed it as part of the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310), her first headlining tour.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wvusuy1359418321.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb2stN7kH28", "strMusicVidDirector": "Trey Fanjoy", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "84950461", "intMusicVidLikes": "190044", "intMusicVidDislikes": "6442", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "5", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "273500", "intTotalPlays": "1835067", "strMusicBrainzID": "08f535c5-b651-4cc2-a8a8-349aa6060b16", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "ba1d0c2a-bb07-38bc-835c-a880f76f1309", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "20244d07-534f-4eff-b4d4-930878889970", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
