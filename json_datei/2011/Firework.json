The song was written by Perry, Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Sandy Wilhelm, Ester Dean, and produced by Stargate and Sandy Vee for Perry's third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). The song is a self-empowerment anthem with inspirational lyrics, and was considered by Perry as the most important song for her on Teenage Dream and is also Perry's single through her third album which is not written or produced with her other collaborators Max Martin & Dr. Luke.\n\n\"Firework\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with some noticing its catchy melody and danceable beat and comparing it to songs by English band Coldplay. The song was commercially successful, reaching the top spot on Billboard Hot 100 and the top five on 20 charts around the world. The song was released on October 16, 2010 by Capitol Records as the third single from the album. As of December 2012, the song has sold over 6 million copies in the US alone, making Perry the only artist with three songs topping the 5 million mark. It is also the best selling song that was a third single or older, that wasn't a part of a re-release. On the week ending of January 8, 2011, \"Firework\" sold 509,000 digital downloads in the US, which is the fourth highest amount ever sold by a female artist behind Taylor Swift's \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (623,000), Kesha's \"Tik Tok\" (610,000), tied with Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" (509,000) and the fifth highest sales week overall. The song is the third consecutive number-one single of the same album; the last female singer who achieved this was Monica in 1998.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, was released on October 28, 2010. It portrayed Perry singing and dancing around Budapest, with intercalating scenes of outcast teenagers become confident in themselves. An open casting call for the music video drew an unprecedented 38,000 applicants. On MuchMusic's top 50 videos of 2010, \"Firework\" reached the top position. The music video was said to be a more upbeat take on Christina Aguilera's message in \"Beautiful\". It was nominated for three awards at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, eventually winning one of those, the Video of the Year, the main and final award. Firework was nominated for Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards. On January 5, 2012, \"Firework\" was elected the fifth most played single on U.S. radio during 2011 by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, with 509,000 plays. Currently, it was the most viewed video of Perry on Youtube.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rvyrqv1359422790.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGJuMBdaqIw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Dave Meyers", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rqsprq1364484491.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ystwtq1364484501.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wrqqqr1364484515.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "1222518291", "intMusicVidLikes": "4440306", "intMusicVidDislikes": "228514", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "414762", "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "918847", "intTotalPlays": "7922394", "strMusicBrainzID": "9846e3f4-7bb9-49be-8e91-837a5ee5cefb", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e6f683c9-fc85-412c-a352-d6e411fc2603", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
