The song was released on February 8, 2011. It was written by Kesha, along with Klas \u00c5hlund, Lukasz Gottwald, Allan Grigg, Benjamin Levin and Max Martin, with production done by Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Benny Blanco and Kool Kojak. According to Kesha the song's lyrics are representative of herself and her fans. \"Blow\" is dominantly an electro and dance-pop song and is described as a party anthem as it portrays a simple message of having a desire to have a good time at a club.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Chris Marrs Piliero and was released February 25, 2011. The video co-stars actor James Van Der Beek, who plays Kesha's nemesis. Piliero and Kesha came up with the video's concept and is intended to be simplistic, a video that is cool and random. Reception of the video by critics were positive, with the mid-video dialogue scene's humor being highlighted.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFWX0hWCbng", "strMusicVidDirector": "Chris Marrs Piliero", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "78306816", "intMusicVidLikes": "426379", "intMusicVidDislikes": "28079", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "64565", "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "343002", "intTotalPlays": "3161585", "strMusicBrainzID": "086112a4-d0f5-4ebb-b445-9c2ed3bf7b1c", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e90dc06b-40a0-4b71-a6b8-c5ed0fdd8c65", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "fab34286-b8e1-4879-bce3-194e1358fbd2", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
