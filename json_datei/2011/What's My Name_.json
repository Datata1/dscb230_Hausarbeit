Featuring guest vocals from Canadian rapper Drake, the song was released as the second single from Loud on October 29, 2010 through Def Jam Recordings. The R&B song was produced by the Norwegian production duo StarGate, and was written by the duo along with Ester Dean, Traci Hale, and Drake. \"What's My Name?\" impacted mainstream and rhythmic radio stations in the United States on October 26, 2010.\n\nMusic critics praised the song as some of Rihanna's best vocal work to date. They also praised its romantic nature, as well as its sexual tones. However, there was some criticism towards Drake's lyrics which included a sexual innuendo about the square root of 69. \"What's My Name?\" was a commercial success, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, giving Rihanna her third number-one single in 2010, as well as her eighth overall. It also became Drake's first number one single. The song also topped the charts in Hungary and the United Kingdom and reached the top five in Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Slovakia. The song has been nominated at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Philip Andelman, portrays a romantic encounter between Rihanna and Drake in a grocery store along with romantic scenes between the pair and Rihanna walking through Manhattan's Lower East Side. \"What's My Name?\" was promoted with live performances across both sides of the Atlantic, including Saturday Night Live in America and the series seven finale of The X Factor in the United Kingdom. The latter performance resulted in an investigation from the country's media regulator, Ofcom, for the raunchy nature of Rihanna's outfit.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tuvvyx1359564075.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0CGsw6h60k", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xxtqrq1419259197.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/surrtv1419259205.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vvprwu1419259211.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "399070241", "intMusicVidLikes": "751379", "intMusicVidDislikes": "42579", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "3", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "2eab2264-5b01-4454-b66c-3eeb46d37e0c", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "7c6de97d-bf6a-4793-82f5-f142baed33e6", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "73e5e69d-3554-40d8-8516-00cb38737a1c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
