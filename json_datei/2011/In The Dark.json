It was written by Dev alongside The Cataracs, who produced it for Dev's debut studio album, The Night the Sun Came Up (2011). The song was released as the album's second single on April 25, 2011, through Universal Republic. \"In the Dark\" came about when Dev wanted to make a sexy song to show that she is a grown woman. She collaborated with American rapper Flo Rida on an official remix as she believed she would enjoy the remix when hearing it on the radio. \"In the Dark\" is a dance-pop song with a saxophone hook and influences of Eurodance and Latin music. The lyrics emphasize sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight.\n\nThe song received generally positive reviews from music critics, who highlighted its production and the saxophone line. However, critics were divided regarding the song's lyrical content; some referred it to as sexy, while others dismissed its metaphors. \"In the Dark\" enjoyed commercial success in the United States, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and the summit of Hot Dance Club Songs. The song achieved its highest national peak in Slovakia, where it reached number one. Elsewhere, the song peaked in the top forty in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. The song's music video features shots of black-painted hands that touch Dev while she is standing naked. According to Dev, the inspiration behind the video was to reflect the sexy and dark aspects of the song, and the initial idea was to create a Tim Burton-inspired feel.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/sryrry1359235379.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgEixhE3Oms", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "57297949", "intMusicVidLikes": "232106", "intMusicVidDislikes": "13913", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "232023", "intTotalPlays": "1416490", "strMusicBrainzID": "ed7752d4-048f-43fa-ab50-6029524df669", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "787ba429-0383-4e62-a3c0-accb673150f7", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "7cc04f00-4c8f-40ea-894c-5f65777b3575", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
