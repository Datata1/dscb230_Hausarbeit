It was written by Brown, Justin Franks, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter and Adam Richard Wiles, and was produced by DJ Frank E. Brown recorded the song for his pop audience as he had been doing a lot of mixtapes and urban records. \"Yeah 3x\" is an uptempo dance-pop, Europop, and electro-house song; it uses a video game-type beat and features a thick bassline and big synth chords.\n\nCritical reception towards the song was positive, with critics praising its production and lyrics. Other critics noted its similarities to Brown's 2008 single \"Forever\". However, its comparisons to Calvin Harris' 2009 single \"I'm Not Alone\" led to controversy. \"Yeah 3x\" attained top-ten positions in Australia, Austria, Belgium (Flanders), Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also reached the top-twenty in Canada, Norway, Slovakia and Sweden. In the United States, the song peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and at number seven on the Pop Songs chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley and filmed at Universal Studios. The video features Brown in various dance sequences in a neighborhood of old time storefronts and brownstones. It also features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. Brown promoted the song with live performances on televised shows, including Dancing with the Stars, Today and the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. It was also included on the set list of his 2011 F.A.M.E. Tour.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qvtsrt1359391765.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mC2ixOAivA", "strMusicVidDirector": "Colin Tilley", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "156306977", "intMusicVidLikes": "412613", "intMusicVidDislikes": "14870", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "7", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "256568", "intTotalPlays": "1554225", "strMusicBrainzID": "34cdfa37-90ef-4595-9e68-48b55d346b06", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "b2168fe2-85a4-474b-8f75-09d7b7b48959", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "c234fa42-e6a6-443e-937e-2f4b073538a3", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
