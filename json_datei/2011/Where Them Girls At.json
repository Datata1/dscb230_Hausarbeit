The track was released on May 2, 2011, via Virgin Records, serving as the lead single from Guetta's fifth studio album, Nothing but the Beat. The track was written by Mike Caren, Jared Cotter, Rida, Guetta, Minaj, Juan and Oscar Silinas, Giorgio Tuinfort and Sandy Vee. Initially, \"Where Them Girls At\" was recorded in 2010 and featured just Rida, however after getting into touch with Minaj about a collaboration, Guetta played Minaj the record and she decided to record vocals for it. Computer hackers obtained an a cappella version of the song, and added their own production before leaking the song online. Guetta and his label subsequently mastered a proper version of the song, released it earlier than planned and called an employee of The Pentagon to investigate the matter. \"Where Them Girls At\" combines electro house with hip hop. An accompanying music video for the song was filmed in Los Angeles in May 2011 and released June 28, 2011.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wuvptx1359408715.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4kVWCSzfK4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Dave Meyers", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "200595002", "intMusicVidLikes": "588317", "intMusicVidDislikes": "22101", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "7a9a8195-67fd-4c11-bfcc-ebc9ac2dec86", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "a2709bdb-e16e-4f71-b1aa-cc68119fb782", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "302bd7b9-d012-4360-897a-93b00c855680", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
