Written by himself, 12-year-old brother and R&B singer Jawan Harris, and produced by Happy Perez, the song is included on his debut album, All I Want Is You (2010). It was first leaked onto YouTube in 2009. It was sent to radio as the album's second single in January 2011. The R&B song features neo-soul influences, and had been noted for its similarities to the work of singer, Jon B.. It has thus far achieved moderate success in the United States but has since atopped on the US R&B charts. \"Sure Thing\" marks Miguel's first number-one hit on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was his most successful single to date, until Adorn's release in 2012, spending over fifty weeks on the charts and still charting. The official remix features rapper Pusha T. He has also worked with other upcoming artists such as J. Cole who is signed with Jay-Z.\n\nLyrically, Miguel uses analogies to express his love interest, such as \"You are the chalk / And I could be your blackboard\" and \"If I'm the lyric baby / You could be the note\".\n\nThe music video premiered on January 17, 2011, was directed by Hype Williams and was shot in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n\nLil' Wayne released a remix of the single on his Sorry 4 the Wait Mixtape on 13th July 2011.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4GJVOMjCC4", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "30199411", "intMusicVidLikes": "134434", "intMusicVidDislikes": "3320", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "206058", "intTotalPlays": "1170234", "strMusicBrainzID": "f7eb64ad-8148-4c96-9d53-5096176fa8ab", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "dce781cd-2fc8-470b-ad6e-e526c9451074", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "285e1285-aecc-478f-a8da-0c8cf69e1217", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
