The song was written by Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Daniel Morris and Lil Wayne, with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The R&B slow-jam serves as the lead single from Here I Am and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including an dubstep-inspired electronic mix by Diplo and a rap remix by Busta Rhymes, Trey Songz and Fabolous.\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's third US top 20 hit and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"Dilemma\". It was certified platinum by the RIAA in August 2011. An accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"Forever and a Day\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. Rowland performed the song for the first time with Trey Songz at the 2011 BET Awards.\"Motivation\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uvrqsy1359616320.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1XozsBN5Z4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Sarah Chatfield", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/swuwry1379178605.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uwtqyw1379178612.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uwrqsw1379178623.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "75511920", "intMusicVidLikes": "279085", "intMusicVidDislikes": "11652", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "191316", "intTotalPlays": "834051", "strMusicBrainzID": "2b5e21d4-c1bb-4b5c-ac21-a9ed8342efdb", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "bb1d8eea-8519-4504-93a4-2baaae1622de", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "31bea673-d23a-4889-8da1-7cb040863268", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
