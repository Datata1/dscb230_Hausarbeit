The song is produced by British record producer Alex da Kid, mixed by Dr. Dre, and was released for digital download through the American iTunes Store on February 1, 2011. It was to appear on Dr. Dre's third studio album Detox, but has however been announced that \"I Need a Doctor\" will not make the final cut of the album.[citation needed]\nMusically, \"I Need a Doctor\" is predominantly a rap song, backed by a \"spacey,\" drum-heavy production, with extra piano keys featured in the introduction and the chorus. Lyrically, the song is largely about Dr. Dre and Eminem's close friendship, and how they have often needed and inspired each other in the past.\nEven though the song was leaked onto the Internet several months in advance of its release, it became a significant commercial success on its official release, particularly in the United States, where it peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Dr. Dre's second highest peaking song on the chart ever, and also peaking in the upper regions of many national charts. As of October 2011, it has sold over 2,206,000 digital copies in the United States alone. This makes it Dr. Dre's first song to reach this point.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA770wpLX-Q", "strMusicVidDirector": "Allen Hughes", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "180298743", "intMusicVidLikes": "826815", "intMusicVidDislikes": "25415", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "103880", "intTotalPlays": "519753", "strMusicBrainzID": "2c939a2e-040c-4488-a8f1-7f40d335bf9d", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "683e3f34-d2c2-4216-bccf-4634918591f2", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "5f6ab597-f57a-40da-be9e-adad48708203", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
