It was released in early 1998. The song was co-written by Eliot Kennedy, Tim Lever and Mike Percy (from the band Dead or Alive), and John McClaughlin. It was co-produced by Eliot Kennedy, Tim Lever and Mike Percy. The track is the band's only top ten hit in the United States. An alternate version of the song, in which J's rap replaces Abs' rap, was made especially for the US release; there are separate videos for each version. Five's biggest hit to date internationally, \"When the Lights Go Out\" is considered somewhat to be their debut single in most countries (except in the UK), peaking at #2 in Australia, reaching the Top 30 in the US on 23 June 1998 and peaking at #10 on 21 July 1998.
