Written and produced by Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, L.A. Reid and Daryl Simmons. It is Boyz II Men's most successful single and replaced Diana Ross and Lionel Richie's \"Endless Love\" as Motown's most successful single. In the United Kingdom, the single was the last Motown single to reach #1 on the UK Singles Chart until Ne-Yo's \"Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)\" achieved the feat twenty years later in 2012. The song is listed at #43 on Billboard's All Time Top 100. The song is often used as a \"last song\" before a radio station changes format, also known as \"blowing up the station\".", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDKO6XYXioc", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "128934078", "intMusicVidLikes": "612175", "intMusicVidDislikes": "24150", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "22388", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "226707", "intTotalPlays": "814345", "strMusicBrainzID": "cec593ff-0591-4cb4-abf2-42103e905e27", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "45758517-f46f-32fb-b49f-a75cfa0514cb", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b42eca0f-9381-43db-badb-1cba080a7dc2", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
