The ballad was released in November 1991 as the second single from their second album, Lean into It (1991). The song reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks and topped the charts in 11 other countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand.\n\nThe song was written and composed by Eric Martin during his teen years, with guitarist Paul Gilbert contributing to its melodic arrangements later on. Writing credit is also given to David Grahame, a songwriter working for the label at the time. The lyrics were inspired by a girl Martin knew when he was younger: \"This girl had a lot of boyfriends who treated her like shit. I wanted to be the knight in shining armor, wanted to be with her. She wasn't having it. It never came to play.\"\n\nWhile in Gilbert's apartment at Yucca Street in L.A., he and Martin were laying out their compositions. Martin had a ballad called \"To Be with You\". Gilbert had his psychedelic rock song called \"Green Tinted Sixties Mind\". Both felt the two songs were strong enough to be included in their upcoming album, despite it being purely rock; and true enough, these songs remained throughout the course of their career as a group and as solo artists.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rywruy1363521918.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6-uJLteKek", "strMusicVidDirector": "Nancy Bennett", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "95655866", "intMusicVidLikes": "647060", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "15294", "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "295639", "intTotalPlays": "1642741", "strMusicBrainzID": "02e7ff58-d8a6-4696-bf7c-8928e1ddd372", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "d08f2fd3-20d7-3f9d-bc71-87ca58ab460f", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "bd1180c4-4252-461f-94dc-543906c02522", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
