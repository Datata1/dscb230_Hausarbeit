It was released to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on July 30, 2018, as the album's fifth single. The song features additional vocals by the City Girls, though they are not credited on the official version.\n\n\"In My Feelings\" is a bounce track, similar to Drake's previous single \"Nice for What\". Upon its release, several outlets reported that the song was about Keshia Chant\u00e9, Drake's first girlfriend and childhood friend. However, it was confirmed that it was actually K'yanna Barber (\"KB\"), a resident of Oakland, CA. Drake also makes references to Jennifer Lopez (\"Jenny\"), who he briefly dated in 2016, and Quality Control duo City Girls, made up of members Yung Miami (\"Resha\") and JT. The City Girls also provide uncredited vocals.\nThe track samples \"Smoking Gun (Acapella Version)\" by Magnolia Shorty for the breakdown. \"Lollipop\" by Lil Wayne is also sampled and the track ends with audio from the episode \"Champagne Papi\" from the television series Atlanta. The song was later slightly altered and re-uploaded to streaming sites with additional sampled vocals from Lil Wayne.\n\nThe song inspired an Internet meme dance challenge known as the \"Kiki Challenge\", \"In My Feelings Challenge\" or \"DoTheShiggy\", the latter being a reference to the comedian Shiggy, who posted a video on his Instagram account of him dancing to the song; this video was credited for inspiring the challenge. The dance challenge is to walk outside of moving vehicles (ghost riding) and dance in oncoming traffic. Originating in the US, the challenge later spread to other parts of the world where in some countries it caused controversy and public concern.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/sqppxv1531080302.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRS_PpOrUZ4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Karena Evans", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "119969650", "intMusicVidLikes": "2936584", "intMusicVidDislikes": "128524", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "233211", "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "dd6c0aa4-9b13-45e3-bac9-6f45f7c0607d", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "857db798-5c31-4d5f-991a-6667f41d8899", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "9fff2f8a-21e6-47de-a2b8-7f449929d43f", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
