That\u2019s a statement and a half,\u201d Bieber teased.\n\nMusic video\nThe official music video was released to YouTube on 27 July 2018, just an hour after the song's release. The video begins on the set of a movie in Hollywood with \"We The Best\" replacing the typical white Hollywood Sign. Bieber helms the director chair alongside Khaled and Asahd. One scene is absolutely oozing with Wayne's World vibes as Khaled and Justin stand atop the faux clouds. Product placement is heavily displayed throughout the blockbuster, boasting different liquors from Bumbu to Ciroc and Belaire. Quavo injects himself into the colorful scene taking on the role of an artist, meticulously painting away at his blank canvas with a parrot mysteriously chilling out on his shoulder. Chance is the last of the co-stars to make an appearance, and the setting immediately switches to a Gatsby-themed party, as the squad dances the night away.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rwrxqt1533068170.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxloC1MKTpg", "strMusicVidDirector": "Colin Tilley", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "121866155", "intMusicVidLikes": "1922845", "intMusicVidDislikes": "125315", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "150974", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "84631", "intTotalPlays": "450529", "strMusicBrainzID": "0da1a8b4-ae3e-46d2-81a3-79ead164f786", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "349cd353-a4b9-485d-a48a-c4e4d48f4499", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "081a2d60-9791-4e05-a075-f1890355eeee", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
