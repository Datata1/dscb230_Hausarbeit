Stapleton was initially only writing songs with Timberlake for the album, before being asked to sing on \"Say Something\". He told Billboard, \"I really just went out to Los Angeles to write songs with him, it's a very fluid process with him, there's a lot going on. That was one of those things where there wasn't necessarily a plan. He was like 'All right, you hop in there and take a verse,' and I'm like, 'You want me to do what?' ... It came out great. I had a blast with him, he's a great creative force and one of those guys that if you get a chance to work with him, you should.\"", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/utrqqw1517311116.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MPbR6Cbwi4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Arturo Perez Jr.", "strMusicVidCompany": "La Blogoth\u00e8que", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "253005044", "intMusicVidLikes": "1039969", "intMusicVidDislikes": "70677", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "29533", "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "6b7e6590-e079-4fe9-a560-cbb1b5f429c6", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "82c8d464-7247-44e4-a10a-8a1cdb6d45c4", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "596ffa74-3d08-44ef-b113-765d43d12738", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
