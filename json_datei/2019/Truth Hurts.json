It was released on September 19, 2017 by Nice Life Recording Company and Atlantic Records. It was written by Lizzo, Jesse Saint John, Steven Cheung, and Ricky Reed, the latter of whom co-produced the track with Tele. Though it did not chart at the time of its release, it saw a sudden increase in popularity after being featured in the Netflix film Someone Great in 2019, boosted by the release of Lizzo's third studio album Cuz I Love You the same week.\n\nComposition\nMusically, it is led by a \"glittering\" piano loop. Lyrically, the song sees the singer addressing boy problems, rapping the lyrics, \"'You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal/ Help you with your career, just a little', she raps. 'You\u2019re \u2018posed to hold me down/ But you\u2019re holding me back/ And that's the sound of me not calling you back'.\"\n\nDuring a 2019 concert in her native Detroit, Lizzo revealed that \"the person I wrote that song about is from Detroit.\"\n\nCommercial performance\nNorth America\nIn the United States, \"Truth Hurts\" was a sleeper hit, being released in September 2017 and eventually receiving recognition in early 2019. On the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, the song debuted at number 50 on the week ending May 18, 2019. Its high debut was due to a Billboard rule that affects songs older than one year from entering the Hot 100 unless obtaining a substantial amount of chart points. The track has since reached a peak of number 14.\n\n\"Truth Hurts\" debuted at number 33 on the Mainstream Top 40 following its entry on the Hot 100 and has so far reached number 21. The song has also entered the top 40 of US Rhythmic charts, where it has reached number 23, becoming Lizzo's highest-charting song.

DIY magazine wrote that the song \"continues to show off her relatable rap\".\n\nThe song's lyrics in which she references the Minnesota Vikings was edited out for one station, Top 40/CHR WIXX Green Bay, due to the Packers rivalry with the aforementioned team, and is also part of the Packers Radio Network.
