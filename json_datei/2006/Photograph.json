It was released in September 2005 as the first single from their fifth studio album, All the Right Reasons. The song made multiple US and UK top 10 charts, peaking at #1 in several of them.\n\nThe music video begins with Chad Kroeger, the video's protagonist, walking along a lonely, sparsely populated street, holding up a photograph of himself and Nickelback's producer, Joey Moi (who is referred to in the line \"And what the hell is on Joey's head?\"). As the song progresses to the line \"And this is where I grew up,\" he walks to a rusty mailbox, addressed as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as \"Hanna High School\" on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, \"And this is where I went to school.\" He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was \"the first girl I kissed\") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The Hanna Roundhouse is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people (\"I miss that town, I miss the faces\") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.\n\nThe video was directed by Nigel Dick and was filmed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada, hometown to the majority of the band.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ryrytw1488467098.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0DU4DoPP4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Nigel Dick", "strMusicVidCompany": "A Band Apart", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "109684794", "intMusicVidLikes": "406645", "intMusicVidDislikes": "20044", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "32824", "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.42857", "intScoreVotes": "7", "intTotalListeners": "617760", "intTotalPlays": "3553945", "strMusicBrainzID": "db4d9338-f5d8-4ff3-98e1-4e4bb6055d1c", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "11c5709d-6939-3519-97e8-6be48f3bd4f2", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "bc710bcf-8815-42cf-bad2-3f1d12246aeb", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
