It was written and produced by Chantal Kreviazuk, Raine Maida and Kara DioGuardi, with additional writing from Clarkson. The song talks about a relationship that is not working out and she wants a lover who will support her, not disappear when she needs him the most. It is a prominent pop rock song.\n\nIt was released as the album's fifth and final single. The song received generally positive reviews from most music critics, who praised the song for being \"an anthemic and classic pop-rock song\" and commended Clarkson's attitude on the song. In March 2006, the single was certified gold by RIAA and has sold over 500,000 copies in all formats in the United States. As of February 2010, \"Walk Away\" has sold over 1.1 million digital copies in the U.S.\n\nThe music video for \"Walk Away\" was developed from a treatment Clarkson had written. She relied on Joseph Kahn to direct it. The video premiered on British music channels on March 6, and on TRL and MuchOnDemand on March 7. Of the fifty days it was eligible for the TRL top ten video countdown, it was at number one nineteen times, including on its last day, June 1. The video was voted thirtieth in VH1's \"Top 40 Videos of the Year\" for 2006. Kelly wrote the treatment for the video, even writing in a scene for her brother and one of her friends.
