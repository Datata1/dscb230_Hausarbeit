It was released on April 27, 2006 on both compact disc and 7 inch vinyl. The song was written by guitarist Ryan Ross. The song reached #7 on the United States Billboard Hot 100. This is the band's only top 40 hit in America.\n\nIn the UK, the song was released on February 27, 2006 as a limited edition single with a free sticker. Because the sticker was included with the CD single, the song was not eligible for the UK singles chart. UK chart rules state that stickers are not allowed in single releases. Later, in September 2006, due to the popularity of the track and following further single releases there of \"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off\" and \"But It's Better If You Do\", going top 40 there, the single was re-released on October 30, 2006. Despite receiving significant radio airplay upon its re-release, the single only reached #25 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nMany U.S. radio stations, in response to the language found in the song, wanted an edited version. The lyrics \"The poor groom's bride is a whore\" and \"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?\" were changed by replacing \"whore\" with a \"shhh\" sound and removing \"god\" in \"goddamn\". Some stations \u2014 generally modern rock stations \u2013 still play the original version.\n\nThe song was covered by Fall Out Boy, fellow Decaydance band, for their live album, ****: Live in Phoenix. (Fall Out Boy commonly uses the song's chorus as a lead-in to \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" in concert.)\n\n\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\" was rank #3 in Billboard's Best 2000's Video poll.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rtpxwr1359661860.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6vs-l5dkc", "strMusicVidDirector": "Shane Drake", "strMusicVidCompany": "Red Van Pictures", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "77841910", "intMusicVidLikes": "397875", "intMusicVidDislikes": "8449", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "10", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "1004694", "intTotalPlays": "8147396", "strMusicBrainzID": "10175a71-2e47-4786-a60e-53dd1eb31821", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "4c2e4e78-6b0f-3ca1-8131-06906e5b56e9", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b9472588-93f3-4922-a1a2-74082cdf9ce8", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
