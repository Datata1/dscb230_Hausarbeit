It was written and produced by Madonna in collaboration with Stuart Price, and released as the lead single from the album. Initially used in a number of television advertisements and serials, the song was released as the album's lead single on October 17, 2005.\n\n\"Hung Up\" prominently features a sample from the instrumental introduction to ABBA's hit single \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", for which Madonna personally sought permission from ABBA's songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus. Musically the song is influenced by 1980s pop, with a chugging groove and chorus and a background element of a ticking clock that suggests the fear of wasting time. Lyrically the song is written as a traditional dance number about a strong, independent woman who has relationship troubles.\n\nThe music video is a tribute to John Travolta, his movies and to dancing in general. Directed by Johan Renck, the clip starts with Madonna clad in a pink leotard dancing alone in a ballet studio and concludes at a gaming parlor where she dances with her backup troupe. Interspersed are scenes of people displaying their dancing skills in a variety of settings, including a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, a small restaurant and the London Underground. It also features the physical discipline Parkour.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uvpqst1401530350.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDwb9jOVRtU", "strMusicVidDirector": "Johan Renck", "strMusicVidCompany": "Black Dog Films", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "410037465", "intMusicVidLikes": "2123318", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "90973", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.8", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "667169", "intTotalPlays": "4752285", "strMusicBrainzID": "d63f9a2c-aea5-4b77-875e-eee7ce1fd734", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "122677be-e664-362d-95eb-be3ae126ec03", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "79239441-bfd5-4981-a70c-55c3f15c1287", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
