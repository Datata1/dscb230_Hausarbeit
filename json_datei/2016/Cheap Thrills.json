In the video, a faceless couple wearing wigs (the dancers Minn Vo and Stefanie Klausman), which have become part of Sia's signature look, win a dance contest on a retro 1960s black-and-white television show reminiscent of American Bandstand or The Buddy Deane Show, using visual effects to recreate the look of early 1960s TV cameras. The video, directed by Lior Molcho, has been viewed more than 1.2 billion times.\n\nSia and Daniel Askill directed a performance video featuring Maddie Ziegler dancing with two male dancers (Wyatt Rocker and Nick Lanzisera) to Ryan Heffington's choreography, which was released on 21 March 2016. The three dancers wear beige, with black and blonde hairstyles and gloves in the half-and-half style used in most of Sia's videos for This Is Acting. They dance on a bare stage, with Sia at a rear corner in the background singing into a microphone while wearing a similar bobbed two-toned wig, a large bow and a white dress. Billboard wrote that \"the video features the same type of intense, captivating choreography as some of  other work. This time, Ziegler is backed by two other dancers, and the trio seems to blend as one\". Teen Vogue said that Ziegler \"delivers another powerful performance\". The video has been viewed more than 320 million times.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uxupws1471540107.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYh-n7EOtMA", "strMusicVidDirector": "Sia", "strMusicVidCompany": "RCA", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rurutu1483436350.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/srrwrp1483436356.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ryuxxv1483436343.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "1732675076", "intMusicVidLikes": "8398559", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "190780", "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.66667", "intScoreVotes": "6", "intTotalListeners": "428056", "intTotalPlays": "4383173", "strMusicBrainzID": "8fcdf7b9-6a1c-40c5-aae0-a489dc8898ef", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2eb49f55-ad2a-43fa-a54f-90d0759d7f62", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "2f548675-008d-4332-876c-108b0c7ab9c5", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
