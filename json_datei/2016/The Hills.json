The vocals in the song span from C4 to E\u266d6.\n\nProducer Illangelo stated \u201dI\u2019m very optimistic and positive with anything I put my energy towards, so for me, Abel\u2019s success now is what I imagined it always should have been. \u2018The Hills\u2019 was an opportunity for us to go back to the classical, original the Weeknd moments of our first mixtapes that I co\u2013produced and mixed in their entirety, and then bringing that into a new context, with a pop arrangement and chords in a faster tempo. It\u2019s the perfect marriage of that.\"\n\nThe music video for \"The Hills\" was directed by Grant Singer. It was uploaded to YouTube on May 27, 2015.

He occasionally is pushed repeatedly by one of the women from the car. At the end of the song, he enters an abandoned mansion, and goes upstairs to a room illuminated with red light. A man holding an apple sits waiting for him, next to two other women, and the video cuts to black.\n\nThe man from inside the mansion is Rick Wilder also appears in both the \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"Tell Your Friends\" music videos.\n\nAnother music video was filmed for the Eminem remix in collaboration with GoPro and United Realities, is a 360-degree virtual reality video in which The Weeknd is seen leaving a venue and heading to his limo.
