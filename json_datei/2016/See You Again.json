The track was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 action film Furious 7 as a tribute to the late Paul Walker, who died in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013 in Valencia, California. The artists co-wrote the song with its co-producers, DJ Frank E and Andrew Cedar, with additional production from Puth and mixing provided by Manny Marroquin. \"See You Again\" was released on March 10, 2015, as the soundtrack's lead single in the United States.\n\n\"See You Again\" was a global commercial success, becoming both Khalifa's and Puth's biggest single to date. It spent 12 non-consecutive weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100, tying Eminem's \"Lose Yourself\" and Black Eyed Peas's \"Boom Boom Pow\" for the longest-running rap number-one single in the country, and topped the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks. It also reached number one in several other countries including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand and Switzerland. The song holds the record for the most-streamed track in a single day on Spotify in the United States. It set the record for most streams in a single week worldwide, and in the United Kingdom also in a single week.
