The song was released as a digital download on 18 September 2015 through Copenhagen Records. It topped the charts in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK and gained successful chart appearances in other European countries, Canada and the United States. The song was written by Lukas Forchammer, Stefan Forrest, Morten Ristorp, and Morten Pilegaard. The song was produced by Stefan Forrest and Morten Ristorp under their stage name Future Animals, and Morten \"Pilo\" Pilegaard.\n\nFrontman Lukas Graham Forchhammer described \"7 Years\" as a song about his life so far and what he hopes to achieve in the future. He said that the reason the lyrics go as far as the age of 60 is because his father died at 61 and he needed to \"pass it to believe it.\" He continued: \"It's a song about growing older. I'm also coming to a realisation that being a father is the most important thing. My biggest dream is not to be some negative old dude, but to have my kids' friends say, 'You're going to visit your dad? Say hi! He\u2019s awesome.' I had a perfect father.\"\n\nRegarding the band's prior failure to break into the UK market Forchhammer stated, \"It's like my father died at exactly the right moment \u2013 and I know that\u2019s something I shouldn't say, but I just did! If my dad hadn\u2019t died in 2012 I wouldn\u2019t have written our song Happy Home, which catapulted us into a Scandinavian success story. I wouldn't have written 7 Years, which got us signed to a publisher in America and ultimately signed to Warner Bros.\"\n\nA music video to accompany the release of \"7 Years\" was first released onto YouTube on 15 December 2015 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-nine seconds. As of March 2016, it has received more than 34 million views.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uwrtqr1457956180.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCob76kigA", "strMusicVidDirector": "Ren\u00e9 Sascha Johannsen", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ytrxyx1483436080.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vuqptv1483436131.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rxrwxu1483436138.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "35622119", "intMusicVidLikes": "328949", "intMusicVidDislikes": "5702", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "17542", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "290869", "intTotalPlays": "2281756", "strMusicBrainzID": "87e36ab4-6914-44ab-b740-7abb37678040", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "0198c1e1-d8eb-4cd2-a7c6-65127ef77142", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "124cec07-44f1-4a99-9aaa-96a5bb9ec0bd", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
