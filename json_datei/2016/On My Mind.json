It was released as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015. It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh. \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica. Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist should not be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head. Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\".\n\n\"On My Mind\" became another top-10 entry in the United Kingdom, as well as in Australia and other five territories, while reaching the top 20 in other seven countries. In the United States, it reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIts Western-themed music video, directed by Emil Nava, was inspired by the 1991 film Thelma & Louise, and shows Goulding in a revenge story in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Emil Nava and Ellie Goulding have joined forces for On My Mind, which sees the singer tearing up Las Vegas on horseback in an Americana-style story of revenge.\n\nShot in classic locations such as vintage hair salons, hotels, trailor parks and casinos, Goulding continues the current pop star fascination with the Lana del Rey-esque damsel of the American West. When her affair with a wealthy casino owner turns sour, Ellie rides her steed into the short-tempered man's place of work to make sure she gets her money's worth.\" (Cat Velez, Promonews)", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H202k7KfZL0", "strMusicVidDirector": "Emil Nava", "strMusicVidCompany": "London Alley", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "251315680", "intMusicVidLikes": "1188447", "intMusicVidDislikes": "57698", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "38241", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "238198", "intTotalPlays": "1868193", "strMusicBrainzID": "9b3e2c72-71f0-4a68-8bec-32f8f77b51a5", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "06d2399d-4b6b-4fff-8570-8fa31c73d9bd", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "33ca19f4-18c8-4411-98df-ac23890ce9f5", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
