Written by Tyler Joseph and produced by Mike Elizondo, the lyrics discuss the harsh end of adolescence and the transition to adulthood. The song was released as a single on April 28, 2015 on the Google Play Store and Amazon, and was issued to top 40 radio stations on November 10. \"Stressed Out\" reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, and number one on Alternative Songs, Hot Rock Songs, Adult Pop Songs and Mainstream Top 40.\n\nThe song focuses on nostalgia for childhood, the pressure of adulthood, and family relationships, and speaks from the point of view of \"Blurryface\", the album's titular character. The line, \"My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think\" is heard throughout the song, alluding to marketing the duo did for the album.\n\nThe music video for \"Stressed Out\" was released on YouTube worldwide on April 27, 2015, directed by Mark C. Eshleman (Reel Bear Media). In the video, the band members ride big-wheel tricycles to each other's houses to record the song. They filmed most of the \"Stressed Out\" video at Josh Dun's childhood home in Ohio. Many members of Dun's and Tyler Joseph's family appear in the video.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vpyxtx1457956491.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY", "strMusicVidDirector": " Mark C.
