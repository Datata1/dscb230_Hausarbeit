The song was released first as a promotional single on November 9, 2015, and later was released as the album's third single. It was written by Ed Sheeran, Benny Blanco and Bieber, and produced by Blanco. An acoustic pop song, \"Love Yourself\" features an electric guitar and a brief flurry of trumpets as its main instrumentation. During the song, Bieber uses a husky tone in the lower registers. Lyrically, the song is a kiss-off to a narcissistic ex-lover who did the protagonist wrong.\n\nOn the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, the song became Bieber's third consecutive number-one, where in the United States it spent 24 non consecutive weeks in the top ten (later named the best-performing single of 2016) and was also Bieber's first number one on the Adult Contemporary chart, while in the United Kingdom it spent six weeks at the top. \"Love Yourself\" topped the charts in fifteen countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Sweden. \"Love Yourself\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance. It was the 7th best selling song of the year in the US.\n\nThe music video for the song was released along with the Purpose: The Movement project on November 14, 2015. It features a couple doing an interpretative dance on their house. Bieber promoted the song with performances on TV shows, as well as awards shows throughout 2015-2016, while adding it on the setlist of his Purpose World Tour.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wtqtpy1483437736.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI", "strMusicVidDirector": "Parris Goebel", "strMusicVidCompany": "SB Projects", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ruvwqy1483437843.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xprspq1483437869.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wxxrys1483437877.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "1534960019", "intMusicVidLikes": "6717763", "intMusicVidDislikes": "479174", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "241738", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "355093", "intTotalPlays": "3061201", "strMusicBrainzID": "cc3f3c3d-aa63-4bad-9f4e-adfc1127d7fd", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2660de3c-56db-4bd1-bf99-e162c68e5712", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "e0140a67-e4d1-4f13-8a01-364355bee46e", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
