The song was released on May 5, 2016, as the second single from the album. Produced by Ricky Reed, the song was written by Trainor, Eric Frederic, Jacob Kasher Hindlin, Jason Derulo, and Peter Svensson. Lyrically, the song extends her compositions about self-love and self-empowerment, urging listeners to be more content and confident with themselves. The song's music video was released on May 9, 2016, but was removed by Trainor the same day, alleging digital manipulation of her body. The following day, a new edit of the video was released. Trainor performed the song on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Good Morning America with a live band and backup dancers.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tttssx1466534181.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDRORgoZxZU", "strMusicVidDirector": "Hannah Lux Davis", "strMusicVidCompany": "Sony Music", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "462968183", "intMusicVidLikes": "2757736", "intMusicVidDislikes": "242692", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "201133", "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "91037", "intTotalPlays": "670149", "strMusicBrainzID": "8886cad5-f348-48fe-8fc6-099a2b2df297", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "dc475b10-44d7-47e8-9cb5-d1a1b3c9495d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b2029169-2574-4305-820f-252a5fde3697", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
