The song was nominated for two Grammys at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in February 1998, and is the band's most successful single to date. \"MMMBop\" was phenomenally successful, especially for a debut single, reaching number one in 27 countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and Mexico. In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks. It was voted the best single of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll, while also topping critics' polls from such media as Rolling Stone, Spin, and VH1, and was ranked as #20 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s.\"\n\nDue perhaps to the song's extraordinary success as well as its \"sugary-sweet\" pop music sound, \"MMMBop\" is also the target of considerable criticism and parody. The song was ranked at #17 on the list of AOL Radio's 100 Worst Songs Ever in 2010, with Matthew Wilkening exclaiming, \"The Dust Brothers produced amazing albums by Beck and the Beastie Boys, which almost makes up for this [song].\" Additionally, Rolling Stone in 2011 voted \"MMMBop\" the 6th worst song of the 90's.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wupsyp1359161167.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHozn0YXAeE", "strMusicVidDirector": "Tamra Davis", "strMusicVidCompany": "O Pictures", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "27136676", "intMusicVidLikes": "74496", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4080", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "8", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "343673", "intTotalPlays": "1406411", "strMusicBrainzID": "5c9ce949-c74c-4c7d-b8d9-361f48562079", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "8ec5da30-dd9c-4d20-a893-8669c8de7371", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "3c0a0074-4f26-4d3b-b723-a66bf6cc3753", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
