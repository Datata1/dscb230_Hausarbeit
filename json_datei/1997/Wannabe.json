Written and composed by the group members in collaboration with Matt Rowe and Richard \"Biff\" Stannard during the group's first professional songwriting session, it was produced by Rowe and Stannard for the group's debut album, Spice, released in November 1996. The song was written, composed, and recorded very quickly but the result was considered lacklustre by their label and was sent to be mixed by Dave Way. The group was not pleased with the result, and the recording was mixed again, this time by Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\n\"Wannabe\" is an uptempo dance-pop song which features Mel B and Geri Halliwell rapping. The lyrics, which address the value of female friendship over the heterosexual bond, became an iconic symbol of female empowerment and the most emblematic song of the group's Girl Power philosophy. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the song won for Best British-Written Single at the 1997 Ivor Novello Awards and for British Single of the Year at the 1997 Brit Awards.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": null, "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": "Jhoan Camitz", "strMusicVidCompany": "Mod Films", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": null, "intMusicVidLikes": null, "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.5", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "485451", "intTotalPlays": "2349436", "strMusicBrainzID": "df45bdbb-9f54-42f9-ab28-73cf450fd184", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "a84293d0-9be2-356d-aea7-e960cb754436", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "bf0caafc-2b20-4e07-ab85-87e14ff430ce", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
