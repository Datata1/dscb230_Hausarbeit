It was co-written by the Spice Girls with Jonathan Buck and Eliot Kennedy, for their debut album Spice (1996). Production duo Absolute incorporated a mix of pop and R&B into the song, which includes a harmonica solo, played by Judd Lander. The song heavily samples After 7's \"What U R 2 Me\". The lyrics\u2014which described the things the group have been through together and how they always have been there for each other\u2014received mixed reviews from critics, who described them as \"confusing\" and felt that the R&B-infused production was a \"bid for street cred\". The song has also been covered by Danish singer-songwriter M\u00d8 which also gained popularity.\n\nThe music video was inspired by the films Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! (1965) and Pulp Fiction (1994), and features the group as a band of female techno-warriors, who use martial arts and high-tech ninja-influenced weapons to capture a hapless male. It includes symbols of male disempowerment, and serves as an example of solidarity and the group's bonding. It received positive reactions from fans and was nominated for numerous awards including the 1996 Smash Hits! Awards, the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards, and the 1997 BRIT Awards.\n\nReleased as the album's second single on 14 October 1996, it became their second number-one single in the United Kingdom, and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It was a commercial success across Europe, reaching the top ten in most of the charts that it entered. As a result of its popularity, the song was released in 1997 in Australia, receiving a gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and in North America, entering the top five in both, Canada and the United States.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xuyqxr1582559370.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ro0FW9Qt-4", "strMusicVidDirector": "Vaughan Arnell", "strMusicVidCompany": "Godman", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wqsrxt1582559391.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/yyrrrw1582559400.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/txptuv1582559408.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "49189386", "intMusicVidLikes": "114686", "intMusicVidDislikes": "6689", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "10914", "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "8.5", "intScoreVotes": "2", "intTotalListeners": "169038", "intTotalPlays": "831799", "strMusicBrainzID": "0163611a-0fe2-40e3-8d20-99ad746076c4", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "4180845c-8700-3fda-af8f-0b9f3a932009", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "bf0caafc-2b20-4e07-ab85-87e14ff430ce", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
