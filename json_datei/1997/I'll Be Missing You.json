Released as the second single from Puff Daddy and the Family's debut album, No Way Out (1997), \"I'll Be Missing You\" samples the Police's 1983 hit song \"Every Breath You Take\" with an interpolated chorus sung by Evans and interpolated rhythm. The song also interpolates the 1929 Albert E. Brumley hymn \"I'll Fly Away\" and features a spoken intro over a choral version of Samuel Barber's \"Adagio for Strings\".\n\nAt the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, the song won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The single spent eleven weeks atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one in 15 other countries; it was the best-performing single of 1997 in Iceland, the Netherlands (Dutch Top 40), and Romania. With shipments of over three million copies in the United States and over one million in both Germany and the United Kingdom, the song has become one of the best-selling singles of all time.\n\nA music video was made to accompany the song, directed by American director Hype Williams and shot in Chicago. Portions of the video were filmed in the Helmut Jahn designed moving walkway tunnel that connects Concourses B and C in Terminal 2 at the O'Hare International Airport. The music video was added to BET and MTV on the week ending on May 11, 1997.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wvpuru1442270116.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": null, "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": "Hype Williams", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": null, "intMusicVidLikes": null, "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "195663", "intTotalPlays": "751196", "strMusicBrainzID": "6c3fb291-db4c-4436-b677-d18286478f5a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "97e0982f-5b01-39d0-88ff-1d7bbb59aa0e", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "049e3c43-9c6e-491f-9fe3-4f8003afc224", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
