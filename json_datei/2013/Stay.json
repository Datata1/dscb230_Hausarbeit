Featuring guest vocals by Mikky Ekko, the song will be released as the second single from Unapologetic on January 7, 2013.\n\n\"Stay\" was written by Ekko and Justin Parker and co-produced by Ekko, Parker and Elof Loelv. It is an R&B piano and guitar driven ballad, which contains lyrical content regarding the temptation and failure of resisting a true love.\n\nThe song garnered a mixed response from music critics. They were divided in their opinion regarding the balladry, with most describing it as a standout track on the album, while a few labeled it as boring. However, critics were unified in their opinion of praising her vocal performance and emotion. Rihanna premiered \"Stay\" on Saturday Night Live, and it was included on the set list of the majority of her 777 Tour promotional tour dates. Upon the release of the album, \"Stay\" debuted at number 16 on the UK R&B Chart due to strong digital download sales.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Sophie Muller, depicts Rihanna naked in a bathtub filled with cloudy water, while Ekko sings in a separate bathroom. Critics likened the vulnerability and raw emotion in the video to the song itself.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xtpytu1360723225.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF8BRvqGCNs", "strMusicVidDirector": "Sophie Muller", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uyywqs1418736272.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uytxrt1418736279.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/strysu1418736286.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "865933369", "intMusicVidLikes": "3429220", "intMusicVidDislikes": "167579", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "151284", "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "6c5c1e00-a2f3-4695-91a5-2372df42006f", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "1ab3ba95-bc96-46f4-bc6d-1e57bc6ad1a0", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "73e5e69d-3554-40d8-8516-00cb38737a1c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
