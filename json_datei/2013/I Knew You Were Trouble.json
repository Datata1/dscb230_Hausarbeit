It was released on October 9, 2012, in the United States by Big Machine Records as the third promotional single from the album. Later, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" was released as the third single from Red on November 27, 2012, in the United States. It was released as the second single from the album in the United Kingdom on December 10, 2012. The song was written by Swift herself and co-written and produced by Max Martin and Shellback. A remix of the song, which features rapper Sammy Adams, is also available.\n\n\"I Knew You Were Trouble\" received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its mainstream appeal yet noted Swift's experimentation with dubstep as relatively limited. Due to strong digital sales, the song debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, selling more than 416,000 copies within its first week, making it Swift's 14th entry in the top ten. It also charted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. After its descent back down the chart, the title slowly began to ascend back up the chart and jumped to a new peak of number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, after selling 582,000 digital copies in US. This became the 4th highest single-week download sales.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ywwwru1359091277.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNoKguSdy4Y", "strMusicVidDirector": "Anthony Mandler", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "205985903", "intMusicVidLikes": "1059069", "intMusicVidDislikes": "91652", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "264401", "intTotalPlays": "3317001", "strMusicBrainzID": "6c449b4b-4aa3-4a5f-b1e6-354d949d794a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "a73cecde-0923-40ad-aad1-e8c24ba6c3d2", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "20244d07-534f-4eff-b4d4-930878889970", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
