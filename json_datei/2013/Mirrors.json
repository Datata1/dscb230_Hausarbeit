The single will be physically released on March 1, 2013 in Germany, as a second single from the album. Mirrors is a string-laden mid-tempo pop ballad, with a duration of eight minutes and four seconds (8:04) It begins with \"triumphant-sounding synths\". The song has a \"buoyant\" chorus, which sees Timberlake \"harmonizing with himself via multi-tracked vocals\". Robbie Daw of Idolator cited the song as being \"something straight out of 2006\". A writer for The Huffington Post cited \"Mirrors\" as being an archetypical Timbaland production, comparing it to Timberlake's 2006 single \"My Love\". The song as being cited as being a combination of Timbaland's \"classic contemporary rhythmic stylings\" with Timberlake's soulful vocals. Los Angeles Times' Mikael Wood described \"Mirrors\" as a cross between Timberlake's 2002 single \"Cry Me a River\" and \"November Rain\" by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses.\nIn \"Mirrors\", Timberlake sings to a lover about \"coming to the realization\" that she is his \"other half\". The singer references \"taking a break from the relationship\", with MTV News noting that \"just like he did with his now-wife, Jessica Biel\": \"It was easy coming back to you/ Once I figured it out, you were right here all along,\" he sings on the chorus. \"It's like you're my mirror, my mirror staring back at me/ I couldn't get any bigger/ With anyone else beside of me.\" Charley Rogulewski of Vibe wrote that the strength of the song is in Timberlake's Neo Blue-eyed soul delivery of the \"catchy\" lyrics, \"I don't want to lose you now. I'm looking right at the other half of me.\"\n\nThe music video for the song was directed by Floria Sigismondi.\n\n\"Clocking in at over 8 minutes, an old couple look back over their life together remembering the good times in Floria's poignant narrative. Mr Timberlake finally makes his appearance in the final section, delivering a stirling performance in front of a hall of mirrors...\" (Jimmy Brown, Promonews)", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ysxusq1363538409.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuZE_IRwLNI", "strMusicVidDirector": "Floria Sigismondi", "strMusicVidCompany": "Believe Media", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "555812932", "intMusicVidLikes": "2753257", "intMusicVidDislikes": "82447", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "127103", "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "9.16667", "intScoreVotes": "6", "intTotalListeners": "543678", "intTotalPlays": "4873857", "strMusicBrainzID": "c01bd40c-5f23-4c34-9238-7a5f226f6c0e", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "deae6fc2-a675-4f35-9565-d2aaea4872c7", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "596ffa74-3d08-44ef-b113-765d43d12738", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
