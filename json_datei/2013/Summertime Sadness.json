The trip hop ballad was released on June 22, 2012 by Interscope Records as the fourth single of the album. Charting across Europe, the single reached the top ten in Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In the spring of 2013, \"Summertime Sadness\" reached number one in Poland and Ukraine. Trap and house remixes of \"Summertime Sadness\" helped Del Rey break into the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart. That chart is where Del Rey's song became a modest hit and marked her first foray into the chart. On the accompanied Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, the single gave Del Rey her first US number-one single in August 2013.  Earlier in 2012, the song also managed to become a rock hit in the US.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, a remixed version of the track by Cedric Gervais was released to American contemporary hit radio and helped the single become a sleeper hit, debuting it at 72 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming the highest charting single of her career in that country with a peak of 6. Switzerland and Austria gave \"Summertime Sadness\" a gold certification; it reached platinum status in Germany and became a top forty year-end hit. The record also reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. It joined BBC Radio 1's and BBC Radio 2's playlists. Gervais' remixed version won a 2014 Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qyxyxv1366393655.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVjsGKrE6E8", "strMusicVidDirector": "Spencer Susser", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "260604706", "intMusicVidLikes": "1126284", "intMusicVidDislikes": "28452", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "74047", "intTrackNumber": "11", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.71429", "intScoreVotes": "7", "intTotalListeners": "798535", "intTotalPlays": "9712891", "strMusicBrainzID": "8c712e50-1822-4caf-9eb1-6d9cf6f8556f", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "4b16a1bc-8644-48ae-9b3e-8ae36aa30cfc", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b7539c32-53e7-4908-bda3-81449c367da6", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
