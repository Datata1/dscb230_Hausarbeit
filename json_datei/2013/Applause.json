Written and produced by Lady Gaga and DJ White Shadow, the song was released on August 12, 2013, by Interscope Records as the album's lead single. Originally intended for a release through mainstream and rhythmic airplay on August 19, 2013, it was rush-released a week earlier after two snippets of the song were leaked online on August 10. Details of the song were revealed throughout 2013 as Gaga tweeted its lyrics in early 2013. A mix of electropop and Eurodance evocative of Gaga's first studio album The Fame, the song deals with how she is dependent on her fans' adoration and her vocals on the track have been compared by music critics to those of Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics and David Bowie. The song received generally positive reviews. Applause failed to debut in the Hot 100, but charted at number six in its second week, thus making it her 12th top-ten single in the United States. The single peaked at number one in Spain and within the top ten in over 10 other countries.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xtxyqp1377641974.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pco91kroVgQ", "strMusicVidDirector": " Inez + Vinoodh", "strMusicVidCompany": "GE Projects", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "189342506", "intMusicVidLikes": "991607", "intMusicVidDislikes": "119918", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "5", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "422222", "intTotalPlays": "7027451", "strMusicBrainzID": "de609a3d-a9e8-4b70-b892-4b5a4cccf63a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "162ae3ad-5593-4a40-b856-d1e7081ba1e3", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "650e7db6-b795-4eb5-a702-5ea2fc46c848", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
