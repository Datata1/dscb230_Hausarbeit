The song was written by Carey and Dave Hall, both serving as primary producers alongside Sean Combs. The song heavily samples Tom Tom Club's 1981 song \"Genius of Love\" and incorporates various other beats and grooves arranged by the former. The song's lyrics describe a woman who is in love with a man, and how every time she sees him she starts fantasizing about an impossible relationship with him. The remix for the song features rap verses from Ol' Dirty Bastard, something Carey arranged to assist in her crossover into the hip-hop market.\n\n\"Fantasy\" became the second song in Billboard history, and the first by a female, to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, aside from topping the Hot 100 chart for eight consecutive weeks, the song topped the charts in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and was a top-five hit in Belgium, Finland, France and the United Kingdom.\n\nCarey performed \"Fantasy\" live on several television and award show appearances around the world. Carey performed the song at the 23rd annual American Music Awards, held on January 29, 1996. Additionally, it was performed live on British music chart program Top of the Pops and on French television. \"Fantasy\" was part of the set-lists on several of Carey's succeeding tours, making its debut during the album's accompanying set of concerts, the Daydream World Tour and is featured on her compilation albums, #1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Remixes (2003) and Playlist: The Very Best of Mariah Carey (2010).\n\nThe cover of the single was shot by top fashion photographer Steven Meisel. The cover for her album Daydream is a cropped version of the single cover. Carey directed the music video for \"Fantasy\", making it her directorial debut. Carey created the video's concept and chose the filming location. After being disappointed with the final result in many of her previous videos, Carey decided to single-handedly direct the video. The video showed Carey's rollerblading through Playland Amusement Park in Rye, New York, singing and enjoying herself. Midway through the video, Ol' Dirty Bastard makes a cameo appearance as a clown. The video concludes with Carey dancing atop the sunroof of a car, with many others present and enjoying the music and celebration.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tCTm5M3Cp8", "strMusicVidDirector": "Mariah Carey", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "15981511", "intMusicVidLikes": "131673", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4584", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "5330", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "5", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "271800", "intTotalPlays": "1522881", "strMusicBrainzID": "04ca399c-7529-4276-ae8c-4329911d6aaa", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "bf0126a1-b79c-3c9c-a892-f4bf4fac2bb0", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "494e8d09-f85b-4543-892f-a5096aed1cd4", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
