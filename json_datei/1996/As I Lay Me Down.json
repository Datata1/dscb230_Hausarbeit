Hawkins. It is from her album Whaler and also appears on The Best of Sophie B. Hawkins. The song is one of her two biggest hits, reaching number six on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart for six weeks during 1995. Outside the United States, the song reached number six in Canada, number seven in Australia, number 19 in New Zealand, and number 24 in the United Kingdom. The song is a ballad in which the singer reminisces about a faraway loved one as she goes to bed and hopes to see them again. It was written in memory of Hawkins' father.\n\nThe music video (directed by Sophie Muller) depicts Hawkins singing while sitting on stairs outside an apartment building in her hometown of New York City. It flashes to Hawkins in a forest swinging on a swing, lying on a tree branch, sitting in a boat, and sitting on a bench. It also shows a little girl running through the forest representing Hawkins as a child.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq-4vIIJO30", "strMusicVidDirector": "Sophie Muller", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "3170211", "intMusicVidLikes": "15741", "intMusicVidDislikes": "382", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "1475", "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "6", "intScoreVotes": "2", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "4e8cb3d1-898a-452e-bada-d1081c5d7ef7", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "3bbcb74c-0db9-389d-8d4f-2c36a311d190", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "fd7a8bc1-1b25-4b4c-b899-8f7b3343a229", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
