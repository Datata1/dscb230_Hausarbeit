It was released by Columbia Records in March 9, 1996 as the third US single and fourth overall. The song was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Manuel Seal. A mid-tempo song, its lyrics describe the feeling of attachment and unity the singer feels towards her estranged lover, even though they are no longer together, she says he will always be a part of her and will \"always be her baby\" even after they move on.\n\nMusic critics praised \"Always Be My Baby\" and it was a commercial success, becoming Carey's 11th chart topper on the US Billboard Hot 100, tying her with Madonna and Whitney Houston for most number-one singles for a female artist at the time. It spent two weeks atop the chart and became Carey's eighth chart topper on the Canadian Singles Chart. In other regions, the song performed well, peaking at number three in the United Kingdom, number five in New Zealand, number 17 in Australia and in the top 20 in most music markets where it charted.\n\nThe song's music video features scenes of Carey frolicking by a campsite in upstate New York, as well as swinging on a large swing over a lake. Additional inter-cuts include scenes of two children, one male and female, sneaking out at night and spending time together by a campfire similar to Carey's location. Most scenes from the video were filmed at The Fresh Air Fund's Camp Mariah, named after Mariah Carey for her generous support and dedication to Fresh Air Fund children. The song was performed live during her Daydream World Tour (1996) and many of her future tours and concerts. \"Always Be My Baby\" was also featured in Carey's compilation albums: Number 1's (1998), Greatest Hits (2001), The Ballads (2008) and Number 1 to Infinity (2015).", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tyrwvq1486133944.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfRNRymrv9k", "strMusicVidDirector": "Mariah Carey", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "79192583", "intMusicVidLikes": "266727", "intMusicVidDislikes": "8527", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "15619", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.28571", "intScoreVotes": "7", "intTotalListeners": "340149", "intTotalPlays": "1898105", "strMusicBrainzID": "a9c15481-2329-45e1-a1d8-01e61838a60b", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "bf0126a1-b79c-3c9c-a892-f4bf4fac2bb0", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "494e8d09-f85b-4543-892f-a5096aed1cd4", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
