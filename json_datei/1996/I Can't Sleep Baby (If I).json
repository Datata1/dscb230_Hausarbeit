Kelly, from his 1995 album R. Kelly. The hit song spent two weeks as number one on the US R&B chart (Kelly's sixth #1 R&B hit), reaching number five on the US Pop chart.\nThe song is about someone who accidentally ruins his relationship with his lover by distrusting her, and, realizing he was wrong, wants her back.\nThe music video for the song opens with R. Kelly, driving on a snowy road. He is then shown singing outside a house, and then inside the house. He drives to a phone booth, finishing the song outside.
