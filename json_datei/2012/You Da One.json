The song was written by Ester Dean, Dr. Luke, Rihanna, John Hill and Cirkut, while production of the song was handled by Dr. Luke and Cirkut. The song was released as the second single from the album and premiered on November 11, 2011, being released three days later on November 14. The track is a mid-tempo, pop and electropop song, with additional elements of dancehall and reggae genres. The simplistic lyrics speak of Rihanna in a comfortable and happy relationship with her boyfriend, with the singer explaining that he is the only person she feels she needs in her life.\n\n\"You da One\" was met with a positive reception from music critics, who praised the reggae and dancehall composition, and compared the song to Rihanna's previous singles, \"What's My Name?\" (2010) \"Man Down\" (2011), which also embody the same Caribbean vibes and composition. The single was a moderate success, reaching the top twenty on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. It also peaked within the top twenty in Canada, Ireland, Norway, Scotland, Slovakia and Sweden; and managed top ten positions in New Zealand, South Africa and South Korea. The song's performance was thought to be overshadowed by its predecessor, \"We Found Love\"'s prolonged chart success.\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Melina Matsoukas, portrays a photo shoot and also shows some of the song's lyrics stamped across the screen and on Rihanna's body while she performs to the camera.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tqtyup1359354280.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3HeLs8Yosw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Melina Matsoukas", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "131690235", "intMusicVidLikes": "470844", "intMusicVidDislikes": "36928", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "318398", "intTotalPlays": "2726504", "strMusicBrainzID": "87e161a9-8801-483d-8bb7-8d65973d9597", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "15818ec5-bf34-47de-a4e5-260f98828d64", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "73e5e69d-3554-40d8-8516-00cb38737a1c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
