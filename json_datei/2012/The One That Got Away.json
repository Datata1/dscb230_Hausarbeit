The song was written by Perry, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. The latter two produced the song for Perry's third studio album, Teenage Dream (2010). The song is a mid-tempo pop ballad about a lost love. It features a reference to the rock band Radiohead, addresses the relationship of Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash to express the strength of the relationship, and a tribute to Jake Owen.\n\n\"The One That Got Away\" received mostly positive reviews from most music critics, who complimented Perry's serious tone. The song was released in October 2011 by Capitol Records as the sixth and final single from the album, and was followed by its Floria Sigismondi-directed video, which premiered in November 2011 and featured actor Diego Luna.\n\nWith the song entering the top 10, Perry's Teenage Dream becomes just the seventh album in the 53-year history of the Hot 100 to generate at least six top 10s. The song joins the set's first five singles, all of which reached No. 1: \"California Gurls\" (featuring Snoop Dogg), \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\" (featuring Kanye West), and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\". An official remix featuring rapper B.o.B was released to digital retailers on December 20, 2011. An official acoustic was released to digital retailers on January 16, 2012, this version was included in Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection edition.\n\nThe single reached the top of Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs, Adult Top 40 chart, Mainstream Top 40 chart, both more than any other album in chart's history. \"The One That Got Away\" is one of only two releases from Teenage Dream to fail to achieve number one status on the Billboard Hot 100, the other being \"Wide Awake\". \"The One That Got Away\" is also covered by several artists, including Jordan Pruitt and Selena Gomez & the Scene.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/swxtwu1359422904.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahha3Cqe_fk", "strMusicVidDirector": "Floria Sigismondi", "strMusicVidCompany": "Black Dog Films", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vxqpqq1364485760.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wxtruu1364485769.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uuttty1364485780.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "727418672", "intMusicVidLikes": "2667981", "intMusicVidDislikes": "86091", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "180678", "intTrackNumber": "7", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "499467", "intTotalPlays": "4351814", "strMusicBrainzID": "2d6f51c6-afc5-457e-9c58-689679c08d30", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e6f683c9-fc85-412c-a352-d6e411fc2603", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
