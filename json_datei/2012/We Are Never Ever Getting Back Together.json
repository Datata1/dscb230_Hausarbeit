It was written by Swift with Max Martin and Shellback. Production was handled by Martin and Shellback, with Scott Borchetta serving as executive producer. It was released as the lead single from Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) on August 13, 2012 by Big Machine Records.\n\n\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" is a pop and bubblegum pop song; its lyrics depict Swift's frustrations at an ex-lover who wants to re-kindle their relationship. Rolling Stone named the song the second best song of 2012 while it took the fourth spot in Time's end-of-year poll. It has received a Grammy Award nomination for Record of the Year. It also received a People's Choice Awards nomination for Favorite Song of the Year.\n\nThe song was an instant commercial success. It is the first song in Swift's career to peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and the first song to hold the top spot for more than one week after a huge leap, since Kelly Clarkson's two-week run of \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" after the song rocketed from number 97 to the top spot. A music video for the song was released in August 2012. It was the first music video to be presented in 4K resolution and received positive reviews from critics. A CD single was released in September 2012 by Swift's official store, Amazon.com and US Walmart stores.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uusxtu1359091380.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64", "strMusicVidDirector": "Declan Whitebloom", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "253328572", "intMusicVidLikes": "1061209", "intMusicVidDislikes": "79592", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "8", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "6", "intTotalListeners": "455595", "intTotalPlays": "4907183", "strMusicBrainzID": "44b6ea5d-33dc-4374-bc4a-bb3309db2e5a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "a73cecde-0923-40ad-aad1-e8c24ba6c3d2", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "20244d07-534f-4eff-b4d4-930878889970", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
