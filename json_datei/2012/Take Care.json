The song features guest vocals from Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. The song samples Jamie xx's remix of Gil Scott-Heron's version of \"I'll Take Care of You\". \"Take Care\" was released as the fourth single from the album on February 21, 2012. It is a club song about a couple in a relationship acknowledging they have been hurt in their past, but will look after one another.\n\n\"Take Care\" was met with critical acclaim from music critics, many of whom praised Rihanna's inclusion on the song, as well as her vocal performance. \"Take Care\" was a successful commercial hit, reaching number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, while also reaching the top ten in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. It further peaked at numbers two and eight on the US Rap Songs and Pop Songs charts, and charted within the top ten of the UK R&B Chart.\n\nThe song's accompanying music video, directed by Yoann Lemoine, depicts simplistic art including Drake and Rihanna's characters in an intimate relationship, with other scenes featuring animals such as a bull, blue jay and tropical fish, and various outdoor landscapes. The video portrays the ups and downs of a relationship with poaching and wildfires. Critics praised the video for its simple and minimalistic theme. British indie rock band Florence + the Machine covered the song at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yxwxpu1359421126.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zzP29emgpg", "strMusicVidDirector": "Yoann Lemoine", "strMusicVidCompany": "Iconoclast", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "127922268", "intMusicVidLikes": "482582", "intMusicVidDislikes": "20188", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "423470", "intTotalPlays": "2453443", "strMusicBrainzID": "ec44be26-1069-484e-8e41-eb5cfd39c69c", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "47809021-4515-4215-beea-db3f5dfb6267", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "9fff2f8a-21e6-47de-a2b8-7f449929d43f", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
