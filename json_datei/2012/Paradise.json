The song was released on 12 September 2011 as the second single from their fifth studio album, Mylo Xyloto.\n\nThe song received its radio debut at 7:50 a.m. on The Chris Moyles Show (BBC Radio 1) on 12 September 2011. According to Coldplay's official website, the single was not initially chart eligible in the United Kingdom, because it was available on iTunes as an \"instant grat\" (immediate download) when pre-ordering the album.\n\nFollowing the release of the album on 30 October 2011, the song became chart eligible in the UK and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 14, before taking the number 1 spot on its tenth week, becoming the band's second number-one single after \"Viva la Vida\" in 2008. The song was met with positive reviews, and was the best selling rock song of 2011 in the United Kingdom, selling 410,000 copies.\n\nOn 30 November, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the category Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. On 12 February 2012, Coldplay performed \"Paradise\" live at the Grammys, along with \"Princess of China\".", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xpuyus1340357743.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg", "strMusicVidDirector": "Mat Whitecross", "strMusicVidCompany": "Pulse Films", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/stpsru1372245815.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/yqvpsv1372245828.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uuvrvr1372245835.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "1244664097", "intMusicVidLikes": "5283605", "intMusicVidDislikes": "158553", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "270195", "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "8.66667", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "911242", "intTotalPlays": "8753022", "strMusicBrainzID": "574eafc0-6909-4278-94fa-083ea5aefc61", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "61b7b6cd-86a6-4728-9478-b58c93bca8fd", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
