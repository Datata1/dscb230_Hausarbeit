Inspired by the 2001 death of fellow R&B singer Aaliyah, the terrorist September 11 attacks in New York City, and other different events in the world and in Keys' life at that time, it is about \"how material things don't feed the soul.\" Musically, the slow bluesy piano ballad features musicians Hugh McCracken on guitar and Steve Jordan on drums.\n\nReleased in February 2004 as the album's second single, the song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and became Keys' second consecutive R&B chart-topper, remaining atop the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs for six weeks. The song received two nominations at the 2005 Grammy Awards, for Song of the Year and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, winning in the latter.\n\nA remix featuring Usher, a Kanye West Radio Mix, and a Spanish-language version featuring Arturo Sandoval appear on the bonus CD of select international pressings of The Diary of Alicia Keys. The song is featured in the 2004 PlayStation 2 karaoke game Karaoke Revolution Volume 3.\n\nThe single cover depicts Keys similarly to the subject of Man Ray's 1924 painting Le Violon d'Ingres.\n\nKeys said that the idea of the song was inspired by Aaliyah's death: \"The song idea came together right after Aaliyah passed away. It was such a sad time and no one wanted to believe it. It just made everything crystal clear to me\u2014what matters, and what doesn't.\"\n\nThe music video, directed by Diane Martel, is set in a wintry New York City and features a cameo by rapper and actor Method Man as Keys' on-screen boyfriend. It was actually filmed in Alaska, not New York, as widely rumored.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/t1wigj1646047085.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju8Hr50Ckwk", "strMusicVidDirector": "Diane Martel", "strMusicVidCompany": "DNA", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "96224954", "intMusicVidLikes": "438922", "intMusicVidDislikes": "9255", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "11813", "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.4", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "494437", "intTotalPlays": "2439216", "strMusicBrainzID": "db8ba298-de10-4842-9ae3-7184b33b7eeb", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e53e291f-9a9c-38a0-96e0-86a9b63b776d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "8ef1df30-ae4f-4dbd-9351-1a32b208a01e", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
