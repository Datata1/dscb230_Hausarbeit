Gessle penned it just before Roxette's first tour in 1987. Released at the end of 1989, it was the group's third top 10 showing on the Billboard Hot 100, spending two weeks at #2 in February 1990. It was held out from the #1 spot by the Paula Abdul track \"Opposites Attract\". The music video was performed in the ruins of Borgholm Castle. It was released as a double A-side in the UK, alongside \"Listen to Your Heart\".\n\nThe version on the single features a different introduction, omitting the instruments in favour of the duo singing the first line of the chorus.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rpvtxt1355067956.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "Hold on tight\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nOoo, just a little bit dangerous.\n\nYou pack your bag\nYou take control\nYou're movin' into my heart\nAnd into my soul\nGet out of my way!\nGet out of my sight!\nI won't be walking on thin\nIce to get through the night.\n\nHey, where's your work?\nWhat's your game?\nI know your business\nDon't know your name.\n\nHold on tight\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous.\nShe's got what it takes to make ends meet\nThe eyes of a lover that hit like heat\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous.\n\nYou turn around\nSo hot and dry\nYou're hidin' under a halo\nYour mouth is alive\nGet out of my way!\n(Get out of my way)\nGet out of my sight!\n(Get out of my sight)\nI'm not attracted to go-go\nDeeper tonight.\n\nHey, what's your word?\nWhat's your game?\nI know your business\nBut I don't know your name.\n\nHold on tight\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nShe's got what it takes to make ends meet\nThe eyes of a lover that hit like heat\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nOoo, just a little bit dangerous.\n\n[Instrumental]\n\nHey, hey, hey\nWhat's your word?\nWhat's your game?\nI know your business\nBut I don't know your name.\n\nHold on tight\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nShe's got what it takes to make ends meet\nThe eyes of a lover that hit like heat\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nShe's armed and she's extremely dangerous\nShe's got what it takes to make ends meet\nThe eyes of a lover that hit like heat\nYou know she's a little bit dangerous\nOoo, just a little bit dangerous.\n\nOh, oh\nHey\nWhere's your work?\nMmm, what's your game?\nI don't know your name.\nHey, you!\nOoo, just a little bit dangerous.\nI don't know your name.\nDangerous\nOh-oh-oh.\n", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFNRh26TPmM", "strMusicVidDirector": "Doug Freel", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "32387012", "intMusicVidLikes": "104606", "intMusicVidDislikes": "3591", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "4574", "intTrackNumber": "8", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "116152", "intTotalPlays": "525890", "strMusicBrainzID": "1e23d965-da7b-4c00-a1e7-f8bd6ec9fb29", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "ed44808f-8596-3696-8499-2cdd5f4d21b0", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "d3b2711f-2baa-441a-be95-14945ca7e6ea", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
