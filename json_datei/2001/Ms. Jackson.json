It was released in January 2001 as the second single from their fourth album Stankonia. It topped the U.S. charts for the week of February 17, 2001, and won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. It also reached number one in Germany and number two in the United Kingdom, held from the top spot by Atomic Kitten's \"Whole Again\". In October 2011, NME placed it at number 81 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nThe single helped sell the album following mixed reaction to the lead single \"B.O.B.\", which, despite nearly universal acclaim from critics, failed to chart on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and only reached #69 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nThe song samples \"Strawberry Letter 23\" by The Brothers Johnson (with pitch shifting and reversing) and features an altered version of a tune from \"Bridal Chorus\" from the opera Lohengrin by German composer Richard Wagner (also known as the \"wedding march\"), played on piano.\n\nThe song features live bass instrumentation, performed by Aaron Mills of Cameo, the music of which \"Ms. Jackson\" bears notable similarity to in arrangement.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/syuyyy1359161409.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYxAiK6VnXw", "strMusicVidDirector": "F.
