It is among his most popular singles. This was the second song released off The Blueprint, after the diss track \"Takeover\", but the lead single from it. The song reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. It was Jay-Z's first top 10 single as a lead artist.\n\nThe song, produced by Kanye West, prominently features a sample of \"I Want You Back\" by The Jackson 5, the second major hit in 2001 to sample that song (after \"My Baby\" by Lil' Romeo).\n\nThe music video takes place in New York City with Jay-Z, Damon Dash, Biggs, & other affiliates on a Roc-A-Fella parade float which features cameo appearances from Kanye West, Destiny's Child, Trina, Eve, Nelly, and OutKast.\n\nThe song was later mashed up with Linkin Park's \"In the End\" for their collaborative EP, Collision Course.\n\nThe first verse deals with the rapper's early career as a drug dealer, including his escape from conviction. The second verse narrates his struggles with the exploitative recording industry, while in the last verse he reverts to his childhood growing up in the Marcy Houses housing projects.\n\nThe song's lyrics \"H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A\" use the -izzle language code to spell out HOVA, which refers to a pseudonym given to himself (\"Jayhova\") for his self-proclaimed status as the god of MCs, a reference to Jehovah.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRKmpn3SBdw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Dave Meyers", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "1657439", "intMusicVidLikes": "24150", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "1189", "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "320417", "intTotalPlays": "1069508", "strMusicBrainzID": "64ea3615-a07e-42f6-9ecd-fa6ec6d014b4", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "11ae8c9c-27c1-3308-9761-edb87c8f54ea", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "f82bcf78-5b69-4622-a5ef-73800768d9ac", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
