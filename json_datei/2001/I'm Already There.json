Myers. It was released in March 2001 as the lead-off single to the album of the same name. It spent six weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song was the band's seventh Number One.\n\nThe song's narrator is a man who is on the road, and the lyric explains how he feels and how his family is responding to his absence. This also explains how much the man loves his family, and how much they mean to him. He then says that he will always be there for them in spirit, even though he is separated from them physically. The song became associated with the September 11, 2001 attacks along with family members being deployed and returning from deployment, and has been heard many times on Good Morning America.\n\nOn their 2003 greatest-hits package From There to Here: Greatest Hits, Lonestar included a \"Message from Home\" version which included dubbed-in telephone calls placed by family members of soldiers. This version also omits the line \"And I'll gently kiss your lips / Touch you with my fingertips\" from the second verse.\n\nThe music video premiered on CMT on June 7, 2001 and it was directed by Michael Salomon. On April 21, 2003, they released another version of the music video to recast the song as a tribute to the military. This version is the one that is most-played on TV.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jm5gfuT9Z4", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "7997399", "intMusicVidLikes": "22728", "intMusicVidDislikes": "380", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "7", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "106708", "intTotalPlays": "339261", "strMusicBrainzID": "e4a28875-0b2d-408e-8a5d-56d663586421", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "40d80313-c2be-3e2c-b05e-812fe5a853fc", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "407592bd-6b6e-4803-80fd-f17e59446734", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
