It also featured Pharrell Williams. It was released on July 18, 2000 and was produced by The Neptunes. The single was a huge success for Mystikal, peaking at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100, number three on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number seven on the Hot Rap Singles. Both the song and music video (directed by Little X) received heavy airplay and it has arguably become Mystikal's most well-known song. \"Shake Ya Ass\" was followed by another top 20 hit, \"Danger (Been So Long)\".\n\nThere were two edited versions of the song, allowing radio stations to choose between the two choruses but both versions had amended lyrics. Only the edited version of \"Shake Ya Ass\" was never released as opposed to \"Shake It Fast\" on the album's edited version.\n\nSince its release, the song has been featured in numerous films and other media. It has been featured in the films Kiss of the Dragon, Crossroads, Juwanna Mann, Scary Movie 2 and About A Boy and the HBO television series Treme, also appearing in TV series \"Everybody Hates Chris\" episode Everybody Hates Drew. It also appeared in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV when the player enters the numerous strip clubs around the city.\n\nThe song was listed as the 303rd best song of the 2000s by Pitchfork Media.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vuqvuq1359162749.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb2mnDp68S0", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "4414581", "intMusicVidLikes": "13613", "intMusicVidDislikes": "502", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "112006", "intTotalPlays": "294013", "strMusicBrainzID": "bf2761fe-8b4d-4cc8-bdea-0ccda7c3fed1", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2fb3b471-69ab-3506-ae3e-124066582f7a", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "1cfe52d7-181a-4b3a-8041-d8bf9ccef57b", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
