Scott Stapp wrote the lyrics when he found out with great surprise that he was going to be a father. The song topped the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks in July 2000; a month later it reached the U.S. Top 40. In October, the song hit the top ten and topped Billboard's Adult Top 40 chart for eight weeks. It hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated November 11 for one week, and the video topped VH1's top ten countdown in 2000. In February 2001, Scott Stapp and Mark Tremonti won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song. The song was also nominated for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group, but lost to U2 for \"Beautiful Day\".\n\nIn September, it was announced that Creed would release a limited edition single of \"With Arms Wide Open\" with some profits benefiting Scott Stapp's With Arms Wide Open Foundation to \"promote healthy, loving relationships between children and their families\".\n\nThree main versions of the song exist. One is the original album version. The second is the radio version, which adds additional hi-hat and drums, and also edits out the ending. The third is the video version (or \"Strings Remix\") which adds strings to the radio version.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yxxvry1362465176.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": null, "intMusicVidLikes": null, "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "8", "intLoved": "3", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "472087", "intTotalPlays": "2255335", "strMusicBrainzID": "e21b8fe0-4a0e-41cf-817f-f1bb2ad382e2", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "1e3d8943-22c1-39b1-9b7c-32f594e30db8", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "4b1a830b-0a1f-42e5-b8d5-1d6743912e99", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
