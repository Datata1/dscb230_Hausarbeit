Vocalist Scott Stapp and singer/songwriter Steven Harang wrote the song about the power of lucid dreaming. \"Higher\" was Creed's major breakthrough hit which helped to place them firmly in the US mainstream. It peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated July 22, 2000, and spent 57 weeks upon the survey, which is the longest stay for any Creed song on the Hot 100. Furthermore, it topped both the Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock tallies in the process, setting a then-record of 17 weeks for longest stay at the top of the Mainstream Rock chart. It also charted in the top five on the Adult Top 40 chart.\n\nThe song was written after Stapp used Lucid Dreaming to stop a recurring nightmare he had been experiencing in which he was pursued and killed by a gunman. In the dream, he would turn left at the end of a highway and hide under a bridge, only to be found by his assailant and shot. When he had studied Lucid Dreaming and tried the technique, he was able to turn right and escape the gunman. Stapp stated that after he wrote the lyrics, he never had the dream again.\n\nThe song placed at #95 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs\" in 2009.\n\nCreed's song \"Higher\" was played in many of the theatrical trailers for Titan A.E., but the song did not appear either in the movie or on the soundtrack. The song appeared in the feature film The Skulls. The song was released as downloadable content for the music game Rock Band 2 in July 2010.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qqrwyy1362465326.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://youtu.be/J16lInLZRms", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "10909129", "intMusicVidLikes": "38286", "intMusicVidDislikes": "1326", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.8", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "387797", "intTotalPlays": "1801822", "strMusicBrainzID": "be7c89ab-68a6-4625-b14d-698158a9e6d1", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "1e3d8943-22c1-39b1-9b7c-32f594e30db8", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "4b1a830b-0a1f-42e5-b8d5-1d6743912e99", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
