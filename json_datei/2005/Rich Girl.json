Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). Produced by Dr. Dre, the track features rapper Eve, and is a remake of Louchie Lou & Michie One's 1993 song of the same name, which was in turn an adaptation of the Fiddler on the Roof song \"If I Were a Rich Man\". Stefani says the song discusses her dreams of fame and riches from the perspective of \"when she was just an Orange County girl\".\n\nThe last song to be included on the album, \"Rich Girl\" was released as the album's second single in late 2004 to mixed reviews from music critics. It was a commercial success, reaching the top ten on most of the charts it entered. In the United States, \"Rich Girl\" was certified gold, and it received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 2006 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe music video for \"Rich Girl\" was directed by David LaChapelle and features a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early '80s Vivienne Westwood advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss what they would do if they were a \"rich girl\". The video features several sequences. Stefani is first shown below the deck of a pirate ship, dancing on a table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and wenches and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, \"I need the freaks on this one.\" Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannonfire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qpwsss1385068363.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rlNpWYQunY", "strMusicVidDirector": "David LaChapelle", "strMusicVidCompany": "HSI Productions", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rxqxwx1385068444.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ytvsuy1385068454.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rssuvv1385068494.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "37736743", "intMusicVidLikes": "101824", "intMusicVidDislikes": "2792", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "434964", "intTotalPlays": "1822328", "strMusicBrainzID": "c169ecb4-acbf-48b0-8f6e-545c1f2a7499", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "3873f5a4-e3e2-3e88-ae7e-c2ea5de1a5ba", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "2e41ae9c-afd2-4f20-8f1e-17281ce9b472", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
