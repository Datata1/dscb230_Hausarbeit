Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). As part of Stefani's vision of creating \"a silly dance record\", the song is influenced by 1980s dance and pop music. The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo as a response to Courtney Love's statement that Stefani was a \"cheerleader\" in an interview with Seventeen magazine.\n\nThe song was released as the album's third single in early 2005 and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top ten on the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first digital download to sell one million copies. \"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Record of the Year at the 48th Grammy Awards, yet it divided pop music critics. The CD single bears a \"Parental Advisory: Explicit Content\" label, although the album does not.\n\nThe music video was directed by Paul Hunter and filmed in the Van Nuys and Reseda neighborhoods of Los Angeles, California.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ywxqpy1385069121.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kgjkth6BRRY", "strMusicVidDirector": "Paul Hunter", "strMusicVidCompany": "HSI Productions", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vyswuv1385068666.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rqvwxt1385069051.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qpwyyr1385069059.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "47091508", "intMusicVidLikes": "158023", "intMusicVidDislikes": "5696", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "811294", "intTotalPlays": "3554234", "strMusicBrainzID": "e7e7c3b8-0b9f-4c13-812a-8ff5516ab5f5", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "3873f5a4-e3e2-3e88-ae7e-c2ea5de1a5ba", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "2e41ae9c-afd2-4f20-8f1e-17281ce9b472", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
