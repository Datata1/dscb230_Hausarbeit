The song was written by Terius Nash, Christopher Stewart, Rihanna, and Jeezy, with vocals performed by the latter two. Nash and Stewart produced it under their stage names, The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. \"Hard\" was sent to radio by Def Jam Recordings on November 10, 2009, as the second United States single from Rated R. It is a hip hop song and features military horns, hissing synthesizers, sharp beats and piano chords. Critics commended \"Hard\" for Rihanna's vocal performance and Jeezy's collaboration.\n\nThe song became Rihanna's thirteenth top ten hit on the US Billboard Hot 100, matching Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles as the female artist with the most US top ten songs since 2000. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. An accompanying music video, directed by Melina Matsoukas, was filmed in Los Angeles in December 2009. In the video, Rihanna commands an army while clothed in stylized military costumes. Critics praised the video and noted a difference from her previous clips. After the video premiere, the song charted in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Rihanna performed \"Hard\" at Jay-Z's concert at UCLA Pauley Pavilion and at the 2009 American Music Awards.
