Since its release it has peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number one on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay in its July 31, 2010 issue. The instrumental was produced by Gigamesh. Another version, labeled \"Gigamesh Remix\", was released on Mike Posner's October 2009 mixtape One Foot Out the Door. The original version features \"Cooler Than Me\" \u2013 Mike Posner & the Brain Trust Ft. Big Sean. They were later removed on the single mix.\n\nSpeaking in August 2010 to noted British urban writer Pete Lewis \u2013 Assistant Editor of Blues & Soul \u2013 Posner described the background to the song: \"A lotta people don\u2019t know I recorded that song while was still a student, and that I recorded it in my dorm-room on an extremely cheap microphone! So to now be hearing it on the radio in The States and over here is very special for me, knowing that I made it in such a makeshift manner. And while yes, it is about a specific girl in my class I had a crush on \u2013 though I\u2019m not gonna tell you her name, because she doesn\u2019t deserve any notoriety \u2013 it\u2019s also about a specific type of girl. Because there are girls like that everywhere! You know, everybody knows that girl who thinks she\u2019s cooler than them, which is why I figured I\u2019d just try to capture that moment of feeling snubbed. Because all my songs are either driven by something that\u2019s happened to me, or by something I\u2019ve felt on the inside.\u201d", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yxxsrw1359739626.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqWq_48LxWQ", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "41645312", "intMusicVidLikes": "136219", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4758", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "480999", "intTotalPlays": "2414227", "strMusicBrainzID": "da038eee-0d61-48e6-8622-a228e44690ea", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "4933ec10-b654-411c-a6bc-960b1dd1167e", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "5b64e344-b2fb-47bd-bd7b-4c793b17d472", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
