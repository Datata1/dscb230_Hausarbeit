The song was released in April 2010, as the third single from his debut studio album, B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray. B.o.B co-wrote the song alongside Kinetics & One Love, Alex da Kid, DJ Frank E, and Christine Dominguez. DJ Frank E also co-produced the song with Alex da Kid. The song was released to iTunes on April 13, 2010 and was sent to urban radio on April 27, 2010.\n\n\"Airplanes\" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. Internationally, the song topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten of the charts in in Australia, Canada and the Republic of Ireland. \"Airplanes, Part II\", the sequel to the song, features new verses from B.o.B, and a verse from fellow American rapper Eminem, while Williams's vocals remained intact. This collaboration led to a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals.\n\n\"Airplanes\" was composed by B.o.B, Jeremy \"Kinetics\" Dussolliet, Tim \"One Love\" Sommers, DJ Frank E, Alex \"da Kid\" Grant, and Christine Dominguez. B.o.B wrote his rap verses, while Kinetics & One Love and Christine Dominguez wrote the chorus sung by Paramore lead singer Hayley Williams, and DJ Frank E & Alex da Kid co-produced the music. The original version had verses written by Lupe Fiasco. Later, the song was given to B.o.B by his label.\n\nWilliams' appearance in the song was explained by herself and B.o.B in different interviews to MTV. Williams said Paramore was on tour when she was given the song and she \"liked the part too much\" and accepted to appear on it. B.o.B said he has \"always been a Hayley fan\" and he did not expect a collaboration between them too soon. The duo did not get in the studio together to record the song, they were not together to shoot the music video, and had never even met each other in person, according to Williams. The only time that B.o.B and Williams were able to meet was when they performed \"Airplanes\" live for the first time together during the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. The second time the song was performed together live was during Vanderbilt University's Fall 2010 \"Commodore Quake\" concert in Nashville, TN. During B.o.B.'s performance, Williams came out as a special guest to perform the song.\n\nA music video was shot with Williams. B.o.B shot his scenes for the video in April, but Williams was only able to shoot her parts after the end of Paramore's spring tour, so they were never in the same room during filming. The music video, directed by Hiro Murai, premiered on iTunes on Tuesday June 15, 2010. The video features several frames of B.o.B rapping his verses in a party setting, on stage, and a room filled with lights and occasional song lyrics while Hayley Williams sings the hook in a light filled room and walking through photographs.\n\nThe video was nominated for Video of the Year at the BET Awards of 2011, and at VMA Of 2010.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qyvtxw1359088667.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn6-c223DUU", "strMusicVidDirector": "Hiro Murai", "strMusicVidCompany": "Partizan", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "249248334", "intMusicVidLikes": "739302", "intMusicVidDislikes": "16093", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "99976", "intTotalPlays": "915549", "strMusicBrainzID": "9c3e8053-8ffa-4e3f-81e1-3ca3e371390b", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "dfc3df85-c536-45e5-95a2-b423ee92a103", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "94c338ff-1985-4429-9dc8-997b61bb5932", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
