The track features female vocals by Dev and male vocals by Far East Movement. It was written and produced by The Cataracs. It was number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks ending November 6, 2010, and then again for the week of November 27 of the same year. It is one of only eight singles in Billboard history to return to #1 after two or more other singles had succeeded it in that position. The song has also topped the charts in New Zealand and South Korea and reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Thailand, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia. Many questions surround the meaning of \"G6.\" Some believed it to be a reference to the Pontiac G6; however, Kev Nish clarified that the G6 reference is to an airplane, a Gulfstream IV (G4) hyperbole. \"A G6 is not a Gatorade flavour. It's not a car, convertible, four-door. It's not a watch,\" group member Kev Nish told MTV News. \"But Drake, Drake talks about having G4 pilots on deck, so we said, 'What's flyer than a G4?' Of course, it would be a G6 (Gulfstream G650) .\" Writer and producer Niles Hollowell-Dhar revealed that the reference to a G6 was created primarily in order to rhyme. It samples Dev's single \"Booty Bounce\" as the hook/chorus.\n\nThe song is used in episode Glee's \"Blame It on the Alcohol\", on scene Rachel Berry's party.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xvwuxw1359220915.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "108707669", "intMusicVidLikes": "342818", "intMusicVidDislikes": "18282", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "475786", "intTotalPlays": "3373810", "strMusicBrainzID": "33adb8c3-57c3-48f9-b79d-49ece8991169", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "365f99a0-04be-48cc-8a73-5145d33e53df", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "6bd5655c-b7fe-48ee-8925-c2d2d8798618", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
