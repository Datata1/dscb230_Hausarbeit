Brown co-wrote the song with American rappers Tyga and Kevin McCall, who both appear as guest vocalists on the song. It was produced by McCall. \"Deuces\" was released digitally on June 25, 2010, as the first single from Fan of a Fan. It is a slow, down-tempo R&B ballad featuring elements from the genres of house music and pop music, while the song is lyrically about \"breaking it off with a girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work\". \"Deuces\" was included on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).\n\n\"Deuces\" received positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised the production. Following its release, critics speculated that the lyrics of the song were about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna. \"Deuces\" earned Brown two award nominations; for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards, and Best Collaboration at the 2011 BET Awards. The song was a commercial success in the United States, reaching number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, becoming Brown's first number-one single on the chart since \"Say Goodbye\" (2006). Additionally, it peaked inside the top-thirty in New Zealand, and the top-seventy in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe accompanying music video was directed by Colin Tilley, and shot in black and white at the Los Angeles River. Brown performed \"Deuces\" live on the television show 106 & Park, during his F.A.M.E. Tour (2011), and at Supafest (2012) in Australia. The song's official remix, featuring rappers Kanye West, T.I., Drake, Fabolous, and Andr\u00e9 3000, was released as a digital EP on November 2, 2010. Recording artists Ciara and Teairra Mar\u00ed have also recorded their own remixes of the song.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/spvpwv1359392059.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhBwt9mw7Sk", "strMusicVidDirector": "Colin Tilley", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "15901816", "intMusicVidLikes": "74834", "intMusicVidDislikes": "1896", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "e849f1a5-ab06-4b4f-8149-0a2f15385416", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "b2168fe2-85a4-474b-8f75-09d7b7b48959", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "c234fa42-e6a6-443e-937e-2f4b073538a3", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
