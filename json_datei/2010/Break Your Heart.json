The song serves as the lead single from his second studio album Rokstarr. It was written by Cruz and Fraser T Smith and produced by Smith. It was first released in the UK on 20 September 2009, followed by a release in the United States and other markets on 2 February 2010. The official remix version features American rapper Ludacris; that version was the single released in North American countries. The song, originally penned for Cheryl Cole, is an uptempo R&B song with synthpop and dance-pop elements, accompanied by Cruz's auto-tuned vocals. The song is lyrically a warning to someone about being a heartbreaker.\n\nThe song received mixed to positive reviews, critics commending its infectious sound, but noting that it was generic. The song peaked at number one in Canada, Switzerland, the UK and the United States, and also within the top ten of many other countries. The accompanying music video features several scenes of Cruz on escapades with different women, including a speedboat compared to classic Diddy and a club scene with Ludacris in the American version.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/vwvuxy1359477841.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_SI2EDM6Lo", "strMusicVidDirector": null, "strMusicVidCompany": null, "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "104235319", "intMusicVidLikes": "215028", "intMusicVidDislikes": "5749", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "648292", "intTotalPlays": "3139638", "strMusicBrainzID": "e8e0b98f-81da-405f-b830-85ceb00917f5", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "f4fc9067-305b-412e-b507-c01ab34f4c2c", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "ba7d2626-38ce-4859-8495-bdb5732715c4", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
