Relient K vocalist Matt Thiessen is featured as a guest vocalist in the song. Adam Young described the song as \"a little song about bugs and not being able to fall asleep at night.\" The song is built around a \"bleepy\" 1980s-influenced synthline and includes lyrics about insomnia, fireflies and summer.\n\nThe single attained worldwide success in late 2009-early 2010, topping the charts in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands. \"Fireflies\" was Owl City's only hit in the US Top 40 until three years later when \"Good Time\", featuring Canadian recording artist Carly Rae Jepsen, charted at No. 8.\n\nFireflies was used in the promotional video for Sony's EyePet video game. It is also featured in Disney Sing It: Party Hits.
