Produced by Benny Blanco, and co-written by Kesha, Blanco, Neon Hitch and Sean Foreman, it was released as the album's second single on February 19, 2010, and features 3OH!3. Initial writing of the song took place when Kesha, Blanco, Hitch and Foreman were discussing which sex talked more and which one was more \"obnoxious.\" The song is a midtempo electropop song that speaks of men in the same way that they have talked about women in the music industry. The lyrics depict a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak and features blatant come-ons throughout the song.\n\nCritical reception of the song has been mixed. The song's lyrics were met with mixed reaction by critics, some felt that Kesha's vocal delivery was effective and brash, while other critics dismissed them as trashy. A common complaint amongst critics was the appearance of 3OH!3 stating it was \"superfluous\". The single achieved commercial success by reaching the top five in Australia and Canada, whilst charting within the top ten in the United States and New Zealand. The song became Kesha's second top ten single in Australia, Canada and the United States. It has gone on to sell over two million copies in the United States as well as being certified two times platinum in Canada.\n\nThe music video for \"Blah Blah Blah\" was directed by Brendan Malloy. The video follows similar suit to the song's lyrics; it depicts Kesha getting hit on by a variety of different men and she continually rejects them. Kesha and 3OH!3 performed the song on ninth season of American Idol to promote the single.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xpyvxy1357658186.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3taEuL4EHAg", "strMusicVidDirector": "Brendan Malloy", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "44388889", "intMusicVidLikes": "125228", "intMusicVidDislikes": "14745", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "6", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "307502", "intTotalPlays": "2647937", "strMusicBrainzID": "7e802933-e6c8-410d-8455-db425cd99e02", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "ff7b68e9-ba2f-4a11-8004-52f1f358856a", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "fab34286-b8e1-4879-bce3-194e1358fbd2", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
