Kelly. It was the second single released from his first solo album 12 Play in 1994. The track became a number one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (temporarily interrupting the six-week run of Ace of Base's \"The Sign\"), and it also spent twelve weeks at number one on the U.S. Hot R&B Songs chart as the singer's third #1 R&B hit, becoming the longest-running number-one U.S. R&B single at that time. The song also reached number eight in the UK charts, following the massive success of his previous single, \"She's Got That Vibe\" (which was actually a re-release).\nKelly released 3 versions of \"Bump n' Grind\": the original album version and two remixes. The original LP version was made available for airplay on urban and Top 40 pop radio stations alike at first, but eventually the Old School remix was issued shortly and gained massive airplay on urban, adult R&B/Soul and rhythmic radio stations. Kelly also released the \"Bump N Grind (How I Feel It Extended Mix)\", which was used in the original video for the song. This version received major play on urban radio as well. Some stations still play the original version to this day.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXxkNaRkp8", "strMusicVidDirector": "Kim Watson", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "11913853", "intMusicVidLikes": "29276", "intMusicVidDislikes": "1299", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "200217", "intTotalPlays": "576158", "strMusicBrainzID": "927638b1-d225-41ca-8524-3d60484cc220", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "bec5a775-907b-34e3-b15a-082f8da972e8", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "c2d25856-a09a-4d15-b404-77dd19c19e63", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
