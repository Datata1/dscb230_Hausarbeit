Written by Gabrielle and Tim Laws and produced by Richie Fermie, it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in June 1993. The single entered the UK chart at number 2, which was the highest chart entry a debut female solo act had scored in the UK at that time. The song also peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US and at number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. In Australia, the song made number two on the ARIA Charts.\n\nOriginally the song included a sample of the song \"Fast Car\" by Tracy Chapman, but because of copyright reasons the sample had to be removed. This single is seen as her signature song and the title of her greatest hits compilation Dreams Can Come True, Greatest Hits Vol. 1 is drawn from its lyrics.\n\nThe song was later sampled by the More Fire Crew on their 2002 single \"Dreams\". The song is featured heavily in the 1999 Paul Thomas Anderson film Magnolia, where the character 'Quiz Kid' Donnie Smith plays the song repeatedly as a motivational aid. It is also used in the trailer for the 2000 film Purely Belter.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/xvtvwu1487882625.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5QPirQITZI", "strMusicVidDirector": "Kate Garner", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "3414445", "intMusicVidLikes": "14493", "intMusicVidDislikes": "464", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "696", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "121528", "intTotalPlays": "466715", "strMusicBrainzID": "5025f0be-1065-4edc-8f0c-1014ac56ce08", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "074d197e-0e9a-3952-bec2-5f99844a272b", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "d55fe7ec-3c7f-44e7-b9cc-b025c4351f70", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
