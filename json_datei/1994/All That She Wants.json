It was released in 1992 as the second single from their first studio album, Happy Nation, and, in the following year, it was released as the first single from the 1993 album The Sign in North America. Produced by Denniz Pop, Jonas Berggren, and Ulf Ekberg, the song was inspired by the Kayo song \"Another Mother\".\n\n\"All That She Wants\" is a reggae-pop song that describes a sexually promiscuous woman, with the word \"baby\" being synonymous with \"boyfriend\". The song was first recorded in 1991, but went through many renditions before it was officially released.\n\nThe song was a commercial success, reaching the top of the charts in many countries, including Denmark, Germany, the UK and Australia. The single was certified platinum in the United States, where it peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was one of the best-selling singles of that year.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": "Matt Broadley", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "0", "intMusicVidLikes": "0", "intMusicVidDislikes": "0", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "0", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "3", "intTotalListeners": "532745", "intTotalPlays": "2428378", "strMusicBrainzID": "0db59faa-763a-4c97-b881-0e0a021b1748", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "af3c3c40-d1f3-319b-9950-fb421862f345", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "d4a1404d-e00c-4bac-b3ba-e3557f6468d6", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
