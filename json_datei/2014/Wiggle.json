Production for the song was handled by Ricky Reed. It was recorded at Serenity West Recording in Los Angeles, Tha Compound in Los Angeles and at Start From Infinity \"Joshua Tree Sessions\" and mixed by Manny Marroquin.\n\nProducer Ricky Reed used toy flutes, hand clappers, peanut wrappers, and percussive instruments as sound effects.\n\nJason Derulo chose to collaborate with Snoop Dogg because he \"is the coolest, most swagged-out rapper there is. He's iconic, and I wanted to go for a more iconic look for this one.\" Derulo approached him while they were at an All-Star game. Once he heard the song, Snoop Dogg sent Derulo a message saying: \"This is crazy. I'll get back to you in 48 hours\". \"That's exactly what happened\", Derulo explained.\n\n\"Wiggle\" is an \"upbeat club-ready hip-hop infused R&B song that is about a woman's big fat butt\".\nA music video for the song was released on YouTube on May 21, 2014. It was directed by Colin Tilley and features a cameo appearance from R&B singer Ne-Yo.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/syqrtw1402344632.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiP14ED28CA", "strMusicVidDirector": "Colin Tilley", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/ssxtxu1419258683.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/srwxpq1419258690.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/yrspqs1419258698.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "417460769", "intMusicVidLikes": "1530612", "intMusicVidDislikes": "103815", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "7f9f9829-6bff-47e7-8070-f14c8fb7b67d", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "f914ecbd-e6c2-4b03-bee3-93cb92dab9f8", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "6de0f914-3e60-4418-be3b-42e0feb6eb4d", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
