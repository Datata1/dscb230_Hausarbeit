It was released on March 24, 2014 as the fourth single from his fourth studio album, Crash My Party. On April 17, 2014, \"Play It Again\" became Bryan's eighth non-consecutive chart-topper on the Hot Country Songs, the most by any act in the time since his first #1 \"Rain Is a Good Thing\" hit the top spot on July 24, 2010. Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song 4 stars out of 5, praising both the lyrics for \"[getting] at the emotion that hits young people who are full of life\" and Bryan's charming delivery, which \"sells the song\". Bjorke also commended the label's timing in releasing a feel-good song so close to summertime. \"Play It Again\" debuted at number 46 on the Country Airplay chart for the week ending March 15, 2014. Two weeks later, \"Play It Again\" entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 81 for the week ending March 29, 2014. \"Play It Again\" reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated April 17, 2014. \"Play It Again\" reached No. 1 on the Country Airplay chart for the week ending May 31, 2014; the same week, Florida Georgia Line's \"This Is How We Roll\", on which Bryan is a featured artist, held the No. 2 position on the Country Airplay chart, making Bryan the first artist in the chart's 24-year history to hold the top two positions simultaneously.\n\n\"Play It Again\" was certified Platinum by the RIAA on May 20, 2014. As of June 2014, the song has sold 1,228,000 copies in the United States.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/tptxwp1402486405.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALV-QtDFpSw", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "22365724", "intMusicVidLikes": "110580", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4388", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "61230", "intTotalPlays": "407863", "strMusicBrainzID": "d5d307ae-5341-4499-8480-86a4cb41d4db", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "db8d9da9-1b88-451b-85d2-c4b5886438bc", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "aab35942-f176-4f77-bbf9-1d6aa98ccf3f", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
