The song was written by Perry, Dr. Luke, Max Martin, Bonnie McKee, and Cirkut. \"Roar\" is a midtempo pop song; its lyrics address standing up for oneself.\nSome music critics deemed \"Roar\" a \"determined note\" for Prism, and described it as a \"sure-to-be radio hit\". However other critics thought the lyrics were predictable, \"cheesy\", and contained \"clich\u00e9s\"; describing the song as \"more of a yelp than a roar\".Upon the release, Perry received significant negative press due to accusations of plagiarism stemming from \"uncomfortably close\" similarities between \"Roar\" and Sara Bareilles' \"Brave\".\nThe single became the singer's eighth non-consecutive US Billboard Hot 100 number one, and topped music charts in eight other countries. The music video for \"Roar\" was released on September 5, 2013, which was directed by Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi, and filmed at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rywruy1379263556.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CevxZvSJLk8", "strMusicVidDirector": "Grady Hall and Mark Kudsi", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xpqvtq1418387755.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vrsvvs1418387761.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rptqww1418387768.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "3242407851", "intMusicVidLikes": "12539782", "intMusicVidDislikes": "943587", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "711208", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "555536", "intTotalPlays": "6245436", "strMusicBrainzID": "12f90de0-c330-4664-a43f-05648571f818", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "0d8b973c-fcff-4830-b645-a877b8a9a08f", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "122d63fc-8671-43e4-9752-34e846d62a9c", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
