It features vocals from Hayley Williams, the lead singer of American rock group Paramore. The song was written by Zedd, Williams, Benjamin Eli Hanna, and Carah Faye. \"Stay the Night\" was released to digital retailers on September 10, 2013 by Interscope Records as the lead single off Clarity: Deluxe Edition, the deluxe edition of Clarity.\n\nThe song has been compared to Zedd's previous electro house ballad \"Clarity\", with Critic of Music saying \"Stay the Night\" is primed for \"pop radio\". Digital Spy said the song was \"generic EDM\", and Idolator pointed to its EDM-style club-ready dance beats, \"dreamy\" synths, and a pop-style vocal. \"Stay the Night\" received critical acclaim, with some critics noting the song's potential for crossover appeal to audiences of mainstream pop.\n\nThe single reached the number one spot on both Billboard\u200a'\u200bs Hot Dance Club Songs and Dance/Mix Show Airplay charts in its December 7, 2013 issue, giving Zedd his second number one at Dance Airplay and his third chart topper at Dance Club Play, while Williams marks her first number one on a Billboard chart (at Dance/Mix Show Airplay) as a solo artist.
