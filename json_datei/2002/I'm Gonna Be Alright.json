It was written by Lopez, Lorraine Cheryl Cook, Ronald LaPread and producers Cory Rooney and Troy Oliver. \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\" was remixed by Poke & Tone of Trackmasters for Lopez's first remix album, J to tha L-O! The Remixes (2002). It was released on April 1, 2002, by Epic Records as the album's second single. The remix features rapper Nas and achieved moderate success on the music charts worldwide, and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Lopez's sixth U.S. top ten single.\n\nThe original Track Masters Remix features 50 Cent. At the time of the single release, Epic Records chose Nas for the radio version. Nas re-recorded new rap verses and the track was cut down to 2:52, becoming the Track Masters Remix Radio Edit. Nas replacing 50 Cent caused controversy; and the rappers, who were previously like \"brothers\" have resented each other since. The remix's beat contains re-adaptions of the instrumental used on Luniz's 1995 song \"I Got 5 on It\" featuring Michael Marshall, a song which itself sampled Club Nouveau's 1987 song \"Why You Treat Me So Bad\"", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": null, "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": "Dave Meyers", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": null, "intMusicVidLikes": null, "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "12", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "87304", "intTotalPlays": "248650", "strMusicBrainzID": "48f2163b-0e7b-4da6-a3b5-c68fc92cc1f4", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2b65c975-43ed-3748-8ec1-280b81133c11", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "f0602f55-1770-483d-89bd-4bae0d0ac086", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
