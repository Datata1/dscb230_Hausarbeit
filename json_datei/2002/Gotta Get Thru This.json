It was released in November 2001 as the lead single from his debut studio album of the same name (2002). The track, along with some others, was recorded in Bedingfield's bedroom with his PC and a microphone, using the music software Reason.\n\nThe single went to number one on the UK Singles Chart in both 2001 and 2002, making it one of Bedingfield's most successful singles on the chart. Outside the United Kingdom, the single peaked within the top ten of the charts in Australia, Canada and the United States. In the latter country, it received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording. The single became Britain's sixteenth biggest-selling single of 2001 and has since been certified Platinum.\n\nThe music video features Bedingfield looking for a woman in a number of locations in London, most notably West India Quay, a bridge connecting West India to Canary Wharf, and the Canary Wharf Docklands area. He comes inches close whilst traveling on the Docklands Light Railway, after which he eventually meets up with her again at Canary Wharf. A Canadian director, Little X, directed the video, casting a red-haired American dancer named Gina.\n\nA second version of the video, also directed by Little X, was created for North America. In the beginning of the North American music video, an acoustic version of the song, \"Gotta Get Thru This\" is featured and then the D 'n' D radio edit starts playing after.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rxwtxq1487884350.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4eMyOzD9UI", "strMusicVidDirector": "Director X", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "6620813", "intMusicVidLikes": "24470", "intMusicVidDislikes": "521", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "3626", "intTrackNumber": "3", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "39499", "intTotalPlays": "218672", "strMusicBrainzID": "826df6d0-406c-4151-a7de-98727627e0b5", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "1cc92748-0b99-3b27-bf33-354f40e14842", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "9169bdc6-5725-45ec-bba5-e9df75dbe8cc", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
