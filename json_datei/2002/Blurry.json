The song follows a chord progression of C\u266d\u2013D\u266d\u2013E\u266dm, and the vocals in the song span from C\u266d4 to C\u266d7.\n\nPuddle of Mudd's lead singer Wes Scantlin wrote this about his desire to be a good father and hang with his child. \"Blurry\" angered Scantlin's son's mother when she first heard the song.
