It was written in 1993 and released in 2002. It continued the group's popularity on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 13, though not as successful as the #5 hit \"Blurry\". It also topped the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for one week in October. The popularity of \"She Hates Me\" made it become Puddle of Mudd's second single to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, following \"Blurry\". The song peaked at #14 in the UK Singles Chart, making it the group's third Top 20 hit and won a 2004 ASCAP Pop Music Award.\n\nJimmy Allen was at the time just out of a relationship, and he was inspired to write the song by his former girlfriend's anger. He wrote it before the band gained major success and before they were signed. His girlfriend later apologized to him since she had told him to get a job and stop with his musical career. The song combines upbeat music with lyrics about the break-up. The chord progression is similar to the main chord progression in Suicidal Tendencies' \"I Saw Your Mommy\", which has led to accusations that Puddle of Mudd plagiarized the song.\n\nIn the album's insert is a photocopy of each song's original hand written lyrics. It shows the original name of the song: \"She Fucking Hates Me\". The title was changed to make it more radio- and TV-friendly; however, the line is heard in its original form in the unedited version of the song.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYE4CVhVkhw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Marc Webb", "strMusicVidCompany": "DNA", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "22870522", "intMusicVidLikes": "103019", "intMusicVidDislikes": "2801", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "7094", "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.6", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "425332", "intTotalPlays": "2151496", "strMusicBrainzID": "48ccb8d6-1309-487d-bec1-1da3d6ccdf94", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "3c3e7340-8e64-36a2-900a-0cdfdec83776", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "ff460a70-fdf4-4aa2-b021-8a04da76d88e", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
