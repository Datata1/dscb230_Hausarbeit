The song was written by Aguilera and Scott Storch and was produced by the latter. RCA Records released it to US contemporary hit radio stations on March 13, 2003 as the third single from the album. Musically inspired by band Guns N' Roses' song \"November Rain\", \"Fighter\" combines influences from R&B, rock, arena rock and rock and roll genres. Lyrically, Aguilera thanks a man doing wrong to her for making her stronger.\nMusic critics were mostly positive toward \"Fighter\", praising the song's empowering message and Aguilera's vocal delivery. It peaked at number 20 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments exceeding 500,000 copies in the United States. The single reached the top ten of several national music charts, including those in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands.\nA music video for \"Fighter\" was directed by Floria Sigismondi, inspired by Sigismondi's dark theatrics. Aguilera performed the track on three of her major concert tours: Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), The Stripped Tour (2003) and Back to Basics Tour (2006\u201308). \"Fighter\" has been covered by several artists, including Jordin Sparks and Darren Criss. The stylistic similarities of \"Fighter\" to her song \"Army of Me\" from her 2012 album Lotus would later lead Aguilera to compare the two and consider \"Army of Me\" as a genuine sequel, describing it as \"Fighter 2.0\".", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/spypvy1484313017.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PstrAfoMKlc", "strMusicVidDirector": "Floria Sigismondi", "strMusicVidCompany": "The Revolver Film Co.", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "36895332", "intMusicVidLikes": "140076", "intMusicVidDislikes": "2932", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "9.4", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "475756", "intTotalPlays": "3229551", "strMusicBrainzID": "ad2a2ce9-818d-4caa-9d77-a44fc2358218", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "46feff2b-8218-3432-8a01-a6082b4c93d4", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b202beb7-99bd-47e7-8b72-195c8d72ebdd", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
