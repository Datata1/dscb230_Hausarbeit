It was released by Epic Records on September 26, 2002, as the lead single from her third studio album This Is Me... Then (2002). The song, first leaked online, was written by Lopez, Troy Oliver, Mr. Deyo, Samuel Barnes, Jean-Claude Olivier and Cory Rooney. Rooney and Oliver, along with Poke & Tone of Trackmasters, produced the song. The song was noted by critics for using a large amount musical samples from songs such as 20th Century Steel Band's song \"Heaven and Hell Is on Earth\" (1975) and Boogie Down Productions' \"South Bronx\" (1987). It also contained an unaccredited sample from the track \"Watch Out Now\" (1999) by The Beatnuts, who later called Epic Records and Lopez out on this by releasing a song entitled \"Confused Rappers\".\n\n\"Jenny from the Block\" is a Contemporary R&B and old school hip hop song, which lyrically is about Lopez not changing despite her level of fame and fortune, and never forgetting her roots and where she came from, The Bronx. While some critics praised the song and theme, others disregarded the lyrics as \"silly\" and \"laughable\". Despite this, the song became a commercial success, topping the charts in Canada, reaching number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and charting within the top ten of several major music markets. The song's music video also caused controversy. It featured Lopez and her boyfriend at the time, Ben Affleck, who later credited the video with nearly \"ruining his career\", in several raunchy scenes through the paparazzi's point-of-view. The song has been referenced in popular culture and since its release, Lopez has been referred to Jenny from the Block in the media.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/wtystv1359160845.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dly6p4Fu5TE", "strMusicVidDirector": "Francis Lawrence", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "43029534", "intMusicVidLikes": "83690", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4441", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "7", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "115528", "intTotalPlays": "556452", "strMusicBrainzID": "842b6dbf-27c4-4ce0-ac99-6f86b9b54dba", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "bbf2f06d-3184-3db1-a951-48683b3545a4", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "f0602f55-1770-483d-89bd-4bae0d0ac086", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
