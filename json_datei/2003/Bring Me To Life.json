It was written by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and produced by Dave Fortman. It also features guest vocals from Paul McCoy of the band 12 Stones. Wind-up released \"Bring Me to Life\" in 2003 as the lead single from Evanescence's debut studio album, Fallen. The song delivers genres from alternative metal to rap rock and gothic metal among others.\n\nAccording to Lee, \"Bring Me to Life\" has several meanings and inspirations; its subjects are an incident in a restaurant, open-mindedness, and waking up to the things which are missing in the protagonist's life. Lee later revealed that the song was inspired by her long-time friend and husband Josh Hartzler. Critical response to the song was mostly positive, critics praising the melody of the song, Lee's vocals and their accompaniment by McCoy.\n\nFollowing the inclusion of \"Bring Me to Life\" on the Daredevil soundtrack, it has become a commercial and critical success topping the charts in Australia, the United Kingdom and Italy. It charted in the top ten in more than fifteen countries including the United States, Argentina, Germany and New Zealand. \"Bring Me to Life\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and twice Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as a call for new life in Jesus Christ, which helped the song to chart on the Christian rock charts.\n\nThe band won in the category for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards where the song was also nominated for Best Rock Song. The accompanying music video was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl; it shows Lee singing and climbing on a skyscraper while having nightmares in her bedroom. \"Bring Me to Life\" was part of the set list during the Fallen and The Open Door Tour. Many artists recorded cover versions of the song, including the classical singer Katherine Jenkins and American pianist, John Tesh. The song was also used on several television shows.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bring Me to Life\" was directed by Philipp St\u00f6lzl. After the success of the video, Lee received some film offers. Talking about the video, St\u00f6lzl said: \"On the one hand, it brings out the most catchy part of the song, the bridge, the duet with the male and female vocals. On the other hand, it reflects the  soundtrack background of the song. I did not know if I would have to use a stunt double for most of the angles, which would have restricted me a lot, but then it turned out that Amy did everything herself, hanging on Paul's arm for hours without getting tired. In the end, she is the one who made that shot strong.\"\n\nThe video begins with Amy Lee dressed in a grey nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are performing in another room as Lee awakens and makes her way to the window. Lee exits the room out of the window and proceeds to climb up the side of the building with the wind blowing her hair and nightgown until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose her balance, and she grabs the ledge she was previously standing on. Throughout the bridge and final chorus, McCoy unsuccessfully attempts to pull Lee up, and she falls from his grasp down the building. However, she is then shown asleep in her bed again.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/qpuspp1359577552.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YxaaGgTQYM", "strMusicVidDirector": "Philipp St\u00f6lzl", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/wvxwyr1475831591.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "612902159", "intMusicVidLikes": "4216026", "intMusicVidDislikes": "115763", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "197682", "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "4", "intScore": "9.5", "intScoreVotes": "10", "intTotalListeners": "1165058", "intTotalPlays": "8990329", "strMusicBrainzID": "c24eb26a-04d6-4f09-9449-9bc334f78ede", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "2187d248-1a3b-35d0-a4ec-bead586ff547", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "f4a31f0a-51dd-4fa7-986d-3095c40c5ed9", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
