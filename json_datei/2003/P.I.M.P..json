The song features production from Mr. Porter of D12. The song was mixed by Dr. Dre. A remixed version of the song, featuring fellow rappers Snoop Dogg, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, was released as the album's third official single on August 12, 2003, although the remix was not initially part of the track listing: it was later added as a bonus track to some digital editions of the album.\n\nUpon its release, the song was a significant commercial success, especially in the United States, where it peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached the top ten of many national charts worldwide. The song was later certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of 500,000+ copies.\n\nMusically, the song is based on a highly steel-drum-prominent production from Mr. Porter from D12, and although it is predominantly a rap song, features elements of other genres, especially reggae, or music similar to that of the Caribbeans, within the steel drum-based production Inspired by Mr. Porter's father who is a drummer in a reggae band. Lyrically, the song glorifies 50 Cent's supposed involvement in the 'pimp' lifestyle.\n\nThe music video was directed by Chris Robinson and features the four rappers rapping with topless women. The video comes in two slightly different versions: one with the topless women, and a \"clean\" version without. On July 15, 2003, the video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. At the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, it was nominated for Best Rap Video, but lost to Jay-Z's \"99 Problems\".\n\nThe video had 50 Cent trying to audition to become a member of the P.I.M.P. Legion of Doom and ends up winning their favor by showing off his Magic Stick.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/susqru1368268163.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDApZhXTpH8", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/rrxxtr1527151677.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "181250063", "intMusicVidLikes": "505307", "intMusicVidDislikes": "19090", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "19764", "intTrackNumber": "10", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.71429", "intScoreVotes": "7", "intTotalListeners": "451666", "intTotalPlays": "1483107", "strMusicBrainzID": "98a8c01c-3db9-4dac-b602-71548292d5e1", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "f624ead2-e4ba-4e52-bea5-4362b1c67b14", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "8e68819d-71be-4e7d-b41d-f1df81b01d3f", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
