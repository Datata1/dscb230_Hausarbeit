It was released on September 29, 2009, as the only single of the album by Jive Records. The song was produced by long-time collaborator Max Martin and Shellback, and recorded by Spears in July 2009 while touring Sweden. \"3\" is an uptempo electropop song that features a heavy bassline and synthesizers, and lyrics that talk about threesomes, while referencing American folk-singing trio Peter, Paul and Mary during the chorus as sexual slang.\n\n\"3\" received positive appreciation from contemporary critics, with some reviewers calling it a classic Spears song. The song achieved commercial success by topping the charts in the United States and Canada, as well as reaching the top ten in many countries around the world, including Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song debuted at number one in the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first to debut at the top position in over three years and the first non-American Idol artist in eleven years to do so. \"3\" was also the fifteenth song in the history of Billboard to debut at number one.\n\nAn accompanying music video, directed by Diane Martel, features Spears and her dancers in front of different black and white backgrounds. Martel described it as sexy and playful, while contemporary critics gave it positive reviews, complimenting its simplicity. A director's cut was leaked on December 15, 2009. Spears has performed \"3\" at the Femme Fatale Tour (2011), wearing a white fedora and trench coat.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uvyqts1359596303.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTs6oQx1WJY", "strMusicVidDirector": "Diane Martel", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/sxtsxq1378597745.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/uvwsux1378597755.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vqqsux1378597765.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "40343566", "intMusicVidLikes": "106373", "intMusicVidDislikes": "4271", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "4", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": "401032", "intTotalPlays": "3933650", "strMusicBrainzID": "a75802ee-6031-473e-bf4b-3ec05acd92cb", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "20c4a0b6-50d5-48d4-aad2-33c93b38bd75", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "45a663b5-b1cb-4a91-bff6-2bef7bbfdd76", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
