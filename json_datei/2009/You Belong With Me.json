The song was co-written by Swift and Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. It was released on April 21, 2009, by Big Machine Records as the third single from Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008). Swift was inspired to write \"You Belong with Me\" after overhearing a male friend of hers arguing with his girlfriend through a phone call; she continued to develop a story line afterward. The song contains many pop music elements and its lyrics have Swift desiring an out-of-reach love interest.\n\nCritical reception for \"You Belong with Me\" was middling to positive. The song won Favorite song at 2010 Kids' Choice Awards,and received nominations for the Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. \"You Belong with Me\" enjoyed commercial success as well; it became a top ten hit in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. In the United States, the song became Swift's second best-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 to date and Swift's second best-selling single. It managed to gain the largest crossover radio audience since Faith Hill's \"Breathe\" did in 2000. The single was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was directed by Roman White. The video featured Swift portraying two characters, a nerd (the protagonist and narrator) and a popular girl (the antagonist and girlfriend), while American actor Lucas Till portrayed the male lead. The video's plot centers on the protagonist secretively loving the male lead, although he has a girlfriend. The video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, but during Swift's acceptance speech, rapper Kanye West interrupted, protesting in support of Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles. The incident caused a reaction in the media, with most people coming to Swift's defense. The song was performed live at numerous venues, including the 2009\u201310 Fearless Tour, where it was the opening number. It was covered by various artists, including Butch Walker and Selena Gomez & the Scene, and parodied by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rrxsrp1359418163.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Roman White", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "360063126", "intMusicVidLikes": "1032556", "intMusicVidDislikes": "41215", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "5", "intTotalListeners": "547076", "intTotalPlays": "4910500", "strMusicBrainzID": "70ecebf2-6dc0-4cc8-8f6c-52f7de1fdeb0", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "63eba062-847c-3b73-8b0f-6baf27bba6fa", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "20244d07-534f-4eff-b4d4-930878889970", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
