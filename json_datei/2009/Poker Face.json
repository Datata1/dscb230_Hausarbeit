Produced by RedOne, it was released as the album's second single in late 2008 for some markets and in early 2009 for the rest of the world. The song is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop song in the key of G# minor, following in the footsteps of her previous single \"Just Dance\" but with a darker musical tone. The main idea behind the song is bisexuality and was a tribute by Gaga to her rock n' roll boyfriends.\n\n\"Poker Face\" was well received by most critics, who praised the robotic hook and the chorus. The song attained worldwide success, topping the charts in twenty countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many European countries. \"Poker Face\" is also the most downloaded song in the British chart history. It is among the best-selling singles of all time, having sold over 14 million copies. The accompanying music video for the song portrays Gaga singing it in various costumes and playing strip poker in a getaway villa.\n\nGaga performed the song for the eighth season of the television show American Idol as well as the Fame Ball and Monster Ball tours. The live performances included an electronic version and an acoustic version, which she played on the piano. It was nominated for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year at the 52nd Grammy Awards, and won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. Rolling Stone ranked it number ninety-six on their list of 100 Best Songs of the 2000s decade. In October 2011, NME placed it at number 103 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/uwpquy1359181937.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bESGLojNYSo", "strMusicVidDirector": "Ray Kay", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/xwywut1384001903.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/sxqppr1384001915.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/yttysq1384001926.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "204691614", "intMusicVidLikes": "444599", "intMusicVidDislikes": "35746", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "6", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "9.66667", "intScoreVotes": "6", "intTotalListeners": "1471292", "intTotalPlays": "13988569", "strMusicBrainzID": "080975b0-39b1-493c-ae64-5cb3292409bb", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e5495719-b3ad-3eea-a533-fb70af43c23d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "650e7db6-b795-4eb5-a702-5ea2fc46c848", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
