Produced by RedOne, the track was released as the album's third single in North America and Europe and the fourth single in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden after \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\". \"LoveGame\" was also released as the fourth single in the United Kingdom, after \"Paparazzi\".\n\nThe song was critically appreciated for its catchy tune and the \"I wanna take a ride on your disco stick\" hook. Gaga had explained that the term 'disco stick' is a euphemism for a penis and was inspired by her sexual attraction with a stranger at a night club. Musically carrying the vibe of underground New York discos, the song talks about love, fame and sexuality which was the central theme of the album. \"LoveGame\" has charted within the top ten in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other European countries. It became Gaga's third consecutive number-one song on Billboard's Pop Songs chart.\n\nThe New York underground inspired music video for the song, portrayed Gaga dancing through an underground subway station and in a parking lot. The music video was a tribute by Gaga to the New York lifestyle including its glamour, fans and fashion. The video has several qualities of Michael Jackson's \"Bad\" music video, which also took place in a subway station. In Australia, the music video was banned from being aired at the PG rated time slots because of its sexual content. \"LoveGame\" has been performed live a number of times by Gaga, including her first headlining The Fame Ball and Monster Ball tours, where she performed it while holding her trademark disco stick in one hand.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/sxpptq1359181812.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mB0tP1I-14", "strMusicVidDirector": "Joseph Kahn", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/vuqquv1384000326.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen2": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qwstyx1384000431.jpg", "strMusicVidScreen3": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/mvidscreen/qpsxqw1384000439.jpg", "intMusicVidViews": "110160493", "intMusicVidLikes": "185126", "intMusicVidDislikes": "12860", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "858994", "intTotalPlays": "7374318", "strMusicBrainzID": "baec3223-cf18-4301-bcde-7fd95921ce8a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "e5495719-b3ad-3eea-a533-fb70af43c23d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "650e7db6-b795-4eb5-a702-5ea2fc46c848", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
