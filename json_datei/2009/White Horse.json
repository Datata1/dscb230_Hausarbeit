The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman, with Swift's aid. The song was released on December 8, 2008 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's second studio album Fearless. Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift's ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was not what she had perceived of him. It focused on the moment where Swift accepted the relationship was over. \"White Horse\" is, musically, a country pop song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals. Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to fairytales.\n\nCritically, \"White Horse\" garnered generally positive reception. At the 2010 Grammy Awards, \"White Horse\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. The song also performed well commercially, although it did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, \"Love Story\". In the United States, it peaked at number thirteen in the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on Hot Country Songs. It was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song's accompanying music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. The video features Swift as she decides to end a relationship via phone call. In the video, Swift recalls multiple memories with her love interest, both positive and negative. Swift promoted \"White Horse\" via live performances, including numerous during the Fearless Tour (2009\u201310).", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/yrptux1389658291.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1Xr-JFLxik", "strMusicVidDirector": "Trey Fanjoy", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "77795211", "intMusicVidLikes": "229014", "intMusicVidDislikes": "5606", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "8.75", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "289477", "intTotalPlays": "2165627", "strMusicBrainzID": "c46a220b-32be-4094-b38c-78b84d76ec0a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "63eba062-847c-3b73-8b0f-6baf27bba6fa", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "20244d07-534f-4eff-b4d4-930878889970", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
