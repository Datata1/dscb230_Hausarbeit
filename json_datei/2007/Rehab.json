Written by Winehouse and produced by Mark Ronson, the lyrics are autobiographical, and talk about Winehouse's refusal one time to enter a rehabilitation clinic. It peaked at number 7 in the UK on its Singles Chart and number 9 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100, her first top ten hit in the US.\n\nIt has become a critical and commercial success internationally, and has been referred to as Amy Winehouse's \"signature song\". It won three Grammy Awards in 2008, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and was nominated for two more. It also won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song. Winehouse's public battle with drug and alcohol addiction, and subsequent death, has resulted in some of the song's continuing popularity and appearance in the media. The song has been covered by a list of artists, from Seether to Jamaican Mento band The Jolly Boys, and from Hot Chip to Lea Salonga.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/rxprps1454670568.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc", "strMusicVidDirector": "Phil Griffin", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "104238580", "intMusicVidLikes": "422243", "intMusicVidDislikes": "10863", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "68425", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "2", "intScore": "9.875", "intScoreVotes": "8", "intTotalListeners": "1229868", "intTotalPlays": "8063940", "strMusicBrainzID": "873eba85-b721-4728-be2e-96ce94cccb8b", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "6eac2e57-ee50-36f8-b0c4-c4c847a2c098", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "dfe9a7c4-8cf2-47f4-9dcb-d233c2b86ec3", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
