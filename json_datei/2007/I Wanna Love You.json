It was released in September 2006 as the second single from his second album Konvicted. It is also featured on Snoop Dogg's eighth album, Tha Blue Carpet Treatment. This song is Akon's first #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and is also Snoop's second #1 on the same chart. The song also reached a peak of #3 on the UK singles chart. In the edited clean version of the song, the word \"fuck\" is replaced with \"love\", the word \"pole\" is replaced with \"floor\" and a line in the chorus is rewritten, while \"pussy\" and \"nigga\" are played backwards, and \"dick\" and \"titties\" are blanked out. However, despite the self-censorship, a Parental Advisory sticker was still printed on the cover. The song was originally made by Plies, an up and coming rapper from Fort Myers, Florida, but his verse was replaced by Snoop's for reasons explained below.[citation needed] Even his name has been left out from the writers' credits.[citation needed] This song was #88 on MTV Asia's list of Top 100 Hits of 2007. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award given to the Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in the 50th Grammy Awards of 2008.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/twytqr1345030100.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJzF7H2e3Tw", "strMusicVidDirector": "Benny Boom", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "85879505", "intMusicVidLikes": "169123", "intMusicVidDislikes": "5214", "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "4", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": "127992", "intTotalPlays": "391808", "strMusicBrainzID": "6a76144a-a154-48ae-8f1c-739050d1bbc0", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "69ed59f3-ddd6-3159-a810-b369e4d39e01", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "1138a764-2212-4d0a-b02d-0dc14df91e08", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
