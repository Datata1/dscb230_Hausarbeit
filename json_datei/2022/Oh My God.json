It will be released to US adult contemporary radio as the second single from the album on 29 November 2021, through Columbia Records. The song was written by Adele and Greg Kurstin, with Kurstin being credited as the producer of the track.\n\nBackground and reception\nAnnounced on 1 November 2021 as part of the tracklist, the song appeared as the fifth on Adele's album 30. About the song and its meaning, the singer revealed that it was \"about the first time that I basically left my house after my anxiety and stuff like that started to sort of subside\". After having turned 30, she explained that she was terrified of going on dates in Los Angeles. Talking about one of the first times she flirted after the divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki, she recalled saying, \"'do you mind? I'm married.' And my friends were like, 'but you're not.' And I was like, 'oh s***. OK, oh my God.'\".\n\nUpon album release, the song was chosen as \"Song of the Week\" by Consequence. Writers Mary Siroky and Glenn Rowley described the song as \"refreshing\", while lyrically, it \"replaces outright sadness with internal conflict\". David Cobbald of The Line of Best Fit, however, viewed the inclusion of the song on the album as \"questionable\".\n\nComposition\nContrary to other tracks on 30, the song incorporates more R&B sounds. It deals with a conflict on \"her desire to have fun for once\", while it seems like she never had the chance to do so. The song explores the topic of wanting to \"put yourself out there\" and the consequent difficulties due to being a superstar. Agnes Erickson at TheList.com dedicated an article to the meaning of the song. To her, a \"surprisingly upbeat song about dipping her toes in the romantic pool for the first time\" since the divorce, the lyrics showcase willingness to start dating again after an episode of anxiety that left her \"paralyzed completely\".", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/v4uk6o1643881687.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": null, "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niG3YMU6jFk", "strMusicVidDirector": "Sam Brown", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "50166053", "intMusicVidLikes": "1136274", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "36754", "intTrackNumber": "5", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "a655f293-ea2a-4eec-abc0-31d1c91ebbc5", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "d8a99910-33c2-481d-9b96-085ece5545f6", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "cc2c9c3c-b7bc-4b8b-84d8-4fbd8779e493", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
