It is an afrobeats track with the lyrical theme of divine femininity. After gaining popularity in Europe, where it entered the top 10 in countries like France, Denmark, Greece, Switzerland, Lithuania and Portugal, the song impacted Italian contemporary hit radio as the album's fourth single on October 1, 2021.\n\nComposition\n\"Woman\" is \"an empowering, unabashed ode to womanhood and feminine diversity\" which also explores the thoughts, emotions and woes of being a woman. A bright, high-energy afrobeat song, it has also been described as a fusion of pop, R&B, and reggae. It was co-written by American rapper Jidenna who also provides background vocals to the track. Co-produced by Malawian producer Static. In the lyrics, Doja Cat also details how patriarchy often tries to create competition by putting women against each other, and thus makes a reference to Regina George from Mean Girls (2004). Critics compared her vocal delivery on the track to that of Rihanna (whom she name-drops in the song), and her rap delivery to that of Kendrick Lamar.\n\n\"Woman\" is driven by bouncy steel drums and pulsing bass.\n\nCritical reception\nRosemary Akpan of Exclaim! wrote that \"in typical Doja fashion, she's still able to deliver her usual quick-witted bars, complemented by a catchy chorus.\" Umber Bhatti of Nicki Swift wrote that \"'Woman'\" is the perfect opening song for Planet Her, as it showcases Doja's Cat's ability to create an incredibly fun yet meaningful song.\"\n\nMusic video\nThe song's music video was released on December 3, 2021. It takes inspiration from Michael Jackson's video \"Remember the Time.\" It stars Teyana Taylor alongside actress and model Guetcha. The plot elements and setting of the video take inspiration from the film Dune. In collaboration with Girls Who Code, \"Woman\" became the first codable music video in which fans will be able to make their own edits in JavaScript, Python or CSS using DojaCode.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": "https://www.theaudiodb.com/images/media/track/thumb/ut0nfg1641326046.jpg", "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": null, "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxW5yuzVi8w", "strMusicVidDirector": "Child", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "47238517", "intMusicVidLikes": "2119572", "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "60670", "intTrackNumber": "1", "intLoved": "1", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "1", "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "e12939f6-bab0-4a17-bd3c-9350911a59c8", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "6c90cb91-e615-4545-854b-6d6f10c5cb6d", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "5df62a88-cac9-490a-b62c-c7c88f4020f4", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
