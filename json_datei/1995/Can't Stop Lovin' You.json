It was released in 1995 as the third single from their tenth album Balance. The song emerged after producer Bruce Fairbairn asked for a more pop-oriented song. Instead of searching for his archives, Eddie Van Halen decided to write new music from scratch. The song was written by all members of Van Halen and pays homage to Ray Charles' song \"I Can't Stop Loving You\", particularly in the line where Sammy Hagar sings \"Hey Ray, what you said is true...\"\n\nThe song was Van Halen's most successful single from Balance in the United States, being the only single that reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 30. This would be Van Halen's last song to reach the top 40 in the United States. The single also reached number three on the Canadian RPM Top Singles chart and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twi4sZrWhEE", "strMusicVidDirector": "Peter Christopherson", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": null, "intMusicVidLikes": null, "intMusicVidDislikes": null, "intMusicVidFavorites": null, "intMusicVidComments": null, "intTrackNumber": "2", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": null, "intScoreVotes": null, "intTotalListeners": null, "intTotalPlays": null, "strMusicBrainzID": "24ae917f-c06e-4092-98e9-32150bf80e4a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "3a032793-ecc7-3d8b-9552-d9bb2464e636", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "b665b768-0d83-4363-950c-31ed39317c15", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
