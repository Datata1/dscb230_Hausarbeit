It was released in August 1994 on Zoo Entertainment/SOS Records as their debut single from their album, On the Attack and More. It also appears on 20 Fingers' second self-titled studio album and on Gillette's debut solo album, On the Attack. The tune was a global success, particularly in France and Italy, where it was a number-one hit. It also reached number three in Germany, number four in Australia, number six in Austria and the Wallonia region of Belgium, and number seven in the Netherlands and New Zealand.\n\nThis single, which involves a woman mocking the size of a man's penis, was also released in a toned down version replacing the word \"dick\" with \"short\" (the song was also released under the censored title \"Short Short Man\"). Co-writer Manfred Mohr told the Los Angeles Times that the point of the song was to attract attention. \"We figured there were all these songs by men bashing women and treating women like sex objects. So we decided a song that turned the tables on men might attract some attention.\" According to the vocalist Sandra Gillette, the point of the song is to \"strike back at all the women-bashing songs in pop, especially in rap.\" Some radio stations refused to play the song due perceiving it as misandric, discriminatory and ableistic towards those with microphallism.", "strDescriptionDE": null, "strDescriptionFR": null, "strDescriptionCN": null, "strDescriptionIT": null, "strDescriptionJP": null, "strDescriptionRU": null, "strDescriptionES": null, "strDescriptionPT": null, "strDescriptionSE": null, "strDescriptionNL": null, "strDescriptionHU": null, "strDescriptionNO": null, "strDescriptionIL": null, "strDescriptionPL": null, "strTrackThumb": null, "strTrack3DCase": null, "strTrackLyrics": "", "strMusicVid": "", "strMusicVidDirector": "", "strMusicVidCompany": "", "strMusicVidScreen1": null, "strMusicVidScreen2": null, "strMusicVidScreen3": null, "intMusicVidViews": "0", "intMusicVidLikes": "0", "intMusicVidDislikes": "0", "intMusicVidFavorites": "0", "intMusicVidComments": "0", "intTrackNumber": "9", "intLoved": "0", "intScore": "10", "intScoreVotes": "4", "intTotalListeners": "22960", "intTotalPlays": "73494", "strMusicBrainzID": "03bcdf60-2db7-4954-876a-c99be5f5316a", "strMusicBrainzAlbumID": "4f1e3e1c-a5f9-38fa-9c18-478e6121ae6b", "strMusicBrainzArtistID": "1592a0a6-c7aa-40d7-aa2d-2e3026bb85fa", "strLocked": "Unlocked"}]}
