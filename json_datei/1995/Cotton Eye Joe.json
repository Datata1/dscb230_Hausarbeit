In 2002, \"Cotton Eye Joe\" was remixed in a dance version, and was released from Rednex's greatest hits album, The Best of the West.\n\nThe Rednex version of the song (using \"Eye\" instead of \"Eyed\"), along with a dance-mix version, was very successful in Europe, where it remained at number one in Norway for 15 weeks, Switzerland for 13 weeks, Germany for 10 weeks, Sweden for 8 weeks, Austria for 7 weeks, 3 weeks on the UK Singles Chart and 2 weeks on the Dutch Top 40.
